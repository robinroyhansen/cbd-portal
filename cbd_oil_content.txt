## What is CBD Oil?

**CBD oil** is a liquid extract from the hemp plant combined with a carrier oil such as MCT (coconut), hemp seed, or olive oil. It contains [cannabidiol](/glossary/cannabidiol), a non-intoxicating compound that interacts with your body's [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system).

CBD oil comes in three main formulations:

1. **[Full-spectrum CBD](/glossary/full-spectrum)** — Contains CBD plus other cannabinoids (including trace THC under 0.2%), [terpenes](/glossary/terpene-profile), and flavonoids. These compounds may work together in what's called the [entourage effect](/glossary/entourage-effect).

2. **[Broad-spectrum CBD](/glossary/broad-spectrum)** — Contains multiple cannabinoids and terpenes but with [THC](/glossary/thc) completely removed. A middle ground for those wanting plant compounds without any THC.

3. **[CBD isolate](/glossary/cbd-isolate)** — Pure CBD (99%+) mixed with carrier oil. No other cannabinoids or plant compounds. Best for those who need to avoid THC entirely.

Most CBD oils come in glass bottles with a dropper for measuring doses. Concentrations typically range from 250mg to 3000mg of CBD per bottle.

## How CBD Oil Works

When you place CBD oil under your tongue (sublingual administration), the CBD absorbs through the thin tissue directly into your bloodstream. This bypasses the digestive system and liver, which would otherwise break down much of the CBD before it reaches [circulation](/conditions/circulation).

**How [sublingual](/glossary/sublingual) absorption works:**
- CBD molecules pass through the mucous membrane under your tongue
- They enter the bloodstream directly via capillaries
- CBD then reaches endocannabinoid receptors throughout your body
- It interacts primarily with [CB1](/glossary/cb1-receptor) and [CB2](/glossary/cb2-receptor) receptors, plus [serotonin](/conditions/serotonin) and vanilloid receptors

### Key Numbers: CBD Oil Absorption

| Factor | CBD Oil (Sublingual) |
|--------|---------------------|
| [Bioavailability](/glossary/bioavailability) | 20-30% |
| Onset time | 15-30 minutes |
| Peak effects | 1-2 hours |
| Duration | 4-6 hours |

The carrier oil matters too. [MCT oil](/glossary/mct-oil) absorbs faster than hemp seed oil, while olive oil may enhance absorption of fat-soluble compounds. Some brands add liposomal or nano-emulsion technology to increase [bioavailability](/glossary/bioavailability) further.

## Benefits of CBD Oil

CBD oil remains the most popular CBD format in Europe for several reasons:

### Flexible Dosing
Unlike pre-measured gummies or capsules, oil lets you adjust your dose drop by drop. This is valuable when finding your optimal amount through [titration](/glossary/titration)—starting low and increasing gradually.

### Faster Onset Than Edibles
Sublingual absorption delivers effects in 15-30 minutes compared to 30-60+ minutes for [CBD edibles](/glossary/edible) that must pass through digestion.

### Higher Bioavailability
At 20-30%, sublingual CBD oil delivers more CBD to your system than edibles (10-20% bioavailability) for the same milligram dose.

### Cost-Effective
Milligram for milligram, CBD oil typically costs less than gummies or capsules. A 1000mg bottle provides measurable doses without the manufacturing costs of individual edibles.

### Versatile Use
Beyond sublingual use, CBD oil can be:
- Added to food or drinks
- Applied topically for localised use
- Mixed into homemade edibles

### Full-Spectrum Options Available
Oil formats readily accommodate full-spectrum extracts, giving access to the [entourage effect](/glossary/entourage-effect) that isolate-based products may lack.

## Drawbacks of CBD Oil

No product is perfect. Here's where CBD oil falls short:

### Taste
Natural CBD oil has an earthy, grassy, sometimes bitter flavour that many people dislike. Full-spectrum oils with more plant compounds tend to taste stronger than isolates. Flavoured options help but don't eliminate this entirely.

### Inconvenience
Using oil requires finding a private moment to hold liquid under your tongue, carrying a glass bottle with risk of breakage, and counting drops or measuring carefully.

### Dosing Variability
While flexibility is an advantage, it's also a drawback. Each dropper may not contain exactly the same amount, and user error in measuring is common. Capsules and gummies offer more consistent dosing.

### Shorter Duration
The 4-6 hour duration means you may need multiple doses daily, while slow-release capsules or edibles can last longer.

### Not Always Travel-Friendly
Glass bottles, liquid restrictions on flights, and the appearance of "cannabis oil" can complicate travel, especially internationally.

## How to Use CBD Oil

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Shake the bottle** — Cannabinoids can settle; shaking ensures even distribution.

2. **Fill the dropper** — Squeeze the rubber top, insert into oil, release to fill. Note where the oil level sits (most droppers have measurement markings).

3. **Dispense under tongue** — Lift your tongue and squeeze the dropper to release oil into the sublingual space.

4. **Hold for 60-90 seconds** — This allows absorption through the mucosa. Resist swallowing immediately.

5. **Swallow the remainder** — Any unabsorbed oil will pass through digestion for slower secondary absorption.

### Finding Your Dose


> For more information, see our guide on [CBD Crude Oil: The Raw Extract](/articles/cbd-crude-oil).
There's no universal CBD dose. Factors affecting your ideal amount include body weight, individual metabolism, what you're using it for, and CBD concentration in your product.

**Starting point:** Most guidance suggests beginning with 10-25mg of CBD and adjusting from there. This approach is called [titration](/glossary/titration)—the "start low and go slow" method.

**Calculate your dose:**
- Check the total CBD in the bottle (e.g., 1000mg)
- Check the bottle size (e.g., 30ml)
- Divide to find CBD per ml (1000÷30 = 33mg per ml)
- A standard dropper holds approximately 1ml

### When to Take CBD Oil

- **Morning:** Some prefer CBD oil in the morning for daytime calm without sedation
- **Evening:** Others use it 30-60 minutes before bed for [sleep](/conditions/sleep) support
- **As needed:** CBD oil works well for situational use (before stressful events) due to its faster onset

### With or Without Food?

CBD is fat-soluble, so taking it with food—especially fatty foods—may increase absorption. However, sublingual administration already bypasses digestion, so the difference is less significant than with edibles.

## Who Should Use CBD Oil?

CBD oil is particularly well-suited for:

### [Beginners](/conditions/beginners) Exploring CBD
The ability to start low and adjust gradually makes oil ideal for newcomers finding their [minimum effective dose](/glossary/minimum-effective-dose).

### Those Seeking Fast Effects
If you want to feel something within 30 minutes rather than waiting an hour or more, sublingual oil delivers.

### People Who Need Precise Dosing
Anyone tracking exact milligram intake for consistency benefits from oil's measurability.

### Budget-Conscious Buyers
When comparing cost per milligram, oil typically offers better value than gummies or capsules.

### Those Who Prioritise Full-Spectrum
If the [entourage effect](/glossary/entourage-effect) matters to you, full-spectrum oils provide the richest cannabinoid profile.

**CBD oil may NOT be ideal for:**
- People who strongly dislike the taste (consider CBD gummies)
- Those needing ultra-discreet use in public (capsules work better)
- Frequent travellers (patches or capsules are more portable)
- Anyone who struggles with consistent self-dosing

## CBD Oil vs Other CBD Products

| Factor | CBD Oil | CBD Gummies | CBD Capsules | CBD Topicals |
|--------|---------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Bioavailability** | 20-30% | 10-20% | 10-20% | Local only |
| **Onset time** | 15-30 min | 30-60 min | 30-60 min | 15-45 min |
| **Duration** | 4-6 hours | 6-8 hours | 6-8 hours | 2-4 hours |
| **Taste** | Earthy | Flavoured | None | N/A |
| **Dosing precision** | High (adjustable) | High (pre-measured) | High (pre-measured) | Low |
| **Convenience** | Medium | High | High | Medium |
| **Discretion** | Low | High | High | Medium |
| **Cost per mg** | Low | Medium-High | Medium | High |
| **Best for** | Flexible dosing, fast effects | Taste, convenience | No taste, travel | Localised relief |

**Key insight:** CBD oil offers the best bioavailability of oral CBD products. If you want maximum CBD absorption per milligram spent, oil wins. If convenience and taste matter more, gummies or capsules may suit you better.

## What to Look for When Buying CBD Oil

### Third-Party Lab Testing (COA)

The most important quality indicator. A [Certificate of Analysis](/glossary/certificate-of-analysis) from an independent lab should confirm:
- Actual CBD content matches the label
- THC levels are under 0.2% (EU legal limit)
- No heavy metals, pesticides, or solvents
- No microbial contamination

Reputable brands publish COAs on their website or provide them on request. Avoid any brand that can't show [third-party testing](/glossary/third-party-testing).

### Extraction Method

**[CO2 extraction](/glossary/co2-extraction)** is the gold standard—clean, efficient, and preserves cannabinoids well. Some brands use [ethanol extraction](/glossary/ethanol-extraction), which is also acceptable. Avoid products that don't disclose their extraction method.

### Hemp Source

European-grown hemp under EU regulations offers quality assurance. Look for organic certification where possible. Brands should disclose where their hemp is sourced.

### Carrier Oil

- **MCT oil** — Fast absorption, neutral taste
- **Hemp seed oil** — Additional omega fatty acids, stronger taste
- **Olive oil** — Familiar taste, good absorption

None is objectively "better"—choose based on preference.

### Concentration

Match concentration to your needs:
- **Low (250-500mg per bottle)** — Beginners, light use
- **Medium (500-1000mg)** — Regular users
- **High (1500-3000mg)** — Experienced users, higher dose needs

Higher concentration isn't always better; it's about matching your dose requirements.

### Red Flags to Avoid

- No [third-party testing](/glossary/third-party-testing) available
- Health claims ("cures," "treats," "heals")
- Prices that seem too good to be true
- No information about hemp source
- Unclear or missing ingredient lists
- MLM/multi-level marketing brands


## My Take

After testing over 200 CBD oils in the past 12 years, I consider them the gold standard for CBD delivery. The sublingual method gives you reliable onset timing and lets you dial in your exact dose drop by drop—something I've found invaluable when helping people find their sweet spot.

When evaluating oils, I always check the extraction method (CO2 is my preference), third-party lab reports for potency and contaminants, and carrier oil quality. MCT oil tends to improve absorption, while hemp seed oil adds nutritional value. The biggest red flag? Oils that taste overly bitter or harsh—quality CBD oil should have an earthy, not unpleasant flavor.

The most common mistake I see is people swallowing immediately instead of holding under the tongue for 60-90 seconds. You're essentially turning it into a slow-acting edible at that point. Another issue: starting with high-potency oils before understanding your tolerance.

CBD oil works best for people who want consistent, measurable dosing and don't mind the hemp taste. If you're new to CBD or need precise control over timing and dosage, this is where I'd recommend starting.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does CBD oil take to work?

When taken sublingually (under the tongue), CBD oil typically takes 15-30 minutes to produce noticeable effects. If swallowed directly without holding under the tongue, expect 30-60 minutes as it must pass through digestion. Peak effects usually occur 1-2 hours after taking.

### How much CBD oil should I take?

Start with 10-25mg and observe effects over several days before increasing. Many people find their effective dose between 25-75mg daily, though some use more. Factors like body weight, metabolism, and what you're using it for all influence your ideal dose. Use our [dosage calculator](/tools/dosage-calculator) for guidance.

### Can I take CBD oil with food?

Yes. While sublingual absorption bypasses digestion, any CBD you swallow will absorb better with fatty foods. Taking CBD oil with breakfast or dinner is fine. Some people add it directly to food or drinks, though this converts it fully to an edible (slower onset, lower bioavailability).

### Does CBD oil expire?

Yes. Most CBD oils have a shelf life of 12-24 months when stored properly. Keep your bottle in a cool, dark place—not in direct sunlight or a hot car. Signs of expired CBD oil include cloudiness, off smell, or changed taste. The CBD won't become dangerous, but potency decreases over time.

### Is CBD oil legal in Europe?

CBD oil is legal in most European countries when derived from hemp and containing less than 0.2% THC (0.3% in some countries). However, regulations vary by country, and CBD's status under [Novel Food](/glossary/novel-food) regulations means some products may need authorisation. Check your country's specific rules—see our [CBD legal status guides](/categories/legal).

### What's the difference between CBD oil and hemp seed oil?

CBD oil is extracted from hemp flowers, leaves, and stalks and contains cannabidiol. Hemp seed oil is pressed from hemp seeds and contains no CBD—it's a nutritional oil rich in omega fatty acids. Some products use hemp seed oil as the carrier oil for CBD. Check labels carefully; "hemp oil" alone doesn't guarantee CBD content.
