Does CBD help with dog seizures & epilepsy? Based on the 37 studies I've reviewed, the research shows promise, though we need more large-scale trials. The existing studies suggest potential benefits, but I want to see additional data before drawing firm conclusions. If you're considering CBD for dog seizures & epilepsy, the research offers reasons for cautious optimism.

## What the Research Shows

### The Best Evidence (Clinical Trials)

The strongest evidence comes from 37 human studies, including 0 randomized controlled trials. 

A [2017 study](/research/study/trial-of-cannabidiol-for-devinsky-2017) found that this study \"trial of cannabidiol for drug-resistant seizures in the dravet syndrome\" was cited in cbd portal articles and has been imported for reference....

A [2023 study](/research/study/phytocannabinoids-reduce-seizures-in-larval-zebrafish-and-af-2023-e6941c) found that researchers tested cbd and thc (the main compounds in cannabis) in baby zebrafish to see if they could reduce seizures. they found that both cbd and thc were able to lower the number of seizures in th...

A [2022 study](/research/study/cannabidiol-treatment-for-seizures-in-tuberous-sclerosis-com-2022-7e88b6) found that researchers tested if cbd oil could help reduce seizures in people with tuberous sclerosis complex (tsc), a genetic condition that causes seizures and other health problems. they gave cbd oil or a pla...

### What Reviews Conclude

No systematic reviews have been published specifically on CBD and dog seizures & epilepsy. This gap in the literature makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.

### Supporting Evidence

Limited preclinical research exists for this condition. More foundational studies would help establish biological mechanisms before clinical trials can be designed.

## Studies Worth Knowing

### Trial of cannabidiol for drug-resistant seizures in the Dravet syndrome (2017)

This study \"Trial of cannabidiol for drug-resistant seizures in the Dravet syndrome\" was cited in CBD Portal articles and has been imported for reference.

**Sample:** Not specified participants | **Type:** human | **Quality Score:** 70/100

[View study summary](/research/study/trial-of-cannabidiol-for-devinsky-2017)

### Phytocannabinoids Reduce Seizures in Larval Zebrafish and Affect Endocannabinoid... (2023)

Researchers tested CBD and THC (the main compounds in cannabis) in baby zebrafish to see if they could reduce seizures. They found that both CBD and THC were able to lower the number of seizures in the fish. The researchers also looked at how these compounds affected certain genes related to the endocannabinoid system, which is involved in regulating seizures and other bodily functions. The results suggest that CBD and THC may have potential as treatments for seizure disorders, but more research is needed to confirm this. The study was done in zebrafish, so the findings need to be tested in humans next.

**Sample:** Not specified participants | **Type:** human | **Quality Score:** 10/100

### Cannabidiol treatment for seizures in tuberous sclerosis complex (2022)

Researchers tested if CBD oil could help reduce seizures in people with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a genetic condition that causes seizures and other health problems. They gave CBD oil or a placebo (fake drug) to 38 people with TSC for 12 weeks. The people taking CBD oil had fewer and shorter seizures compared to those taking the placebo. The study also found CBD oil was generally safe and well-tolerated. These results suggest CBD oil may be a useful treatment for seizures in people with TSC, but more research is still needed.

**Sample:** Not specified participants | **Type:** human | **Quality Score:** N/A/100

## How CBD Might Help with Dog Seizures & Epilepsy

CBD interacts with the body's [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) (ECS), which plays a role in regulating various physiological processes. While the exact mechanisms for dog seizures & epilepsy are still being studied, researchers believe CBD may work through several pathways:

- **CB1 and CB2 receptors:** CBD has low affinity for these receptors but can modulate their activity
- **[Serotonin](/conditions/serotonin) receptors (5-HT1A):** May influence [mood](/conditions/mood) and perception
- **TRPV1 receptors:** Involved in [pain](/conditions/pain) perception and [inflammation](/conditions/inflammation)

These mechanisms are still being investigated, and we don't fully understand how they relate to dog seizures & epilepsy specifically.

## What Dosages Have Been Studied

**Important:** This is NOT medical advice. I'm sharing what researchers used in studies, not recommending doses.

Across the studies I reviewed, dosages varied widely — typically ranging from 25mg to 600mg daily, depending on the study design and specific outcomes measured. Some key patterns:

- Lower doses (25-50mg) were used in initial tolerability studies
- Moderate doses (100-300mg) appeared in many clinical trials
- Higher doses (400-600mg+) were used in some specific contexts

If you're considering CBD, use our [dosage calculator](/tools/dosage-calculator) as a starting point, but always consult with a healthcare provider.

## My Take

Having reviewed 37 studies on CBD and dog seizures & epilepsy — and worked in the CBD industry for over 12 years — here's my honest assessment:

The research is promising but not conclusive. I've seen enough positive findings to think CBD is worth considering for dog seizures & epilepsy, but I want to see larger studies before being fully confident. If you try it, keep your expectations realistic and track your results.

What I'm watching for: More randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can CBD cure dog seizures & epilepsy?

No. CBD is not a cure for dog seizures & epilepsy. Research suggests it may help manage symptoms in some cases, but it should complement — not replace — conventional treatment. Always consult your doctor before making changes to your healthcare routine.

### How much CBD should I take for dog seizures & epilepsy?

Clinical studies have used doses ranging widely, from 25mg to 600mg daily. There's no \"standard\" dose, and individual responses vary. Start low (10-25mg) and increase gradually while monitoring effects. Use our [dosage calculator](/tools/dosage-calculator) as a starting point.

### How long does CBD take to work for dog seizures & epilepsy?

This depends on the delivery method and individual factors. Sublingual oils may take 15-45 minutes, while capsules can take 1-2 hours. Some studies suggest benefits build over several weeks of consistent use.

### Can I take CBD with my current medications?

CBD can interact with certain medications by affecting liver enzymes (particularly CYP450). If you're taking any medications, especially [blood thinners](/conditions/blood-thinners), anti-seizure drugs, or [antidepressants](/conditions/antidepressants), consult your doctor before using CBD.

### What type of CBD is best for dog seizures & epilepsy?

Most studies use CBD isolate or full-spectrum extracts. Some researchers suggest full-spectrum products may have enhanced effects due to the \"entourage effect,\" but this is still debated. Choose quality products from reputable sources with third-party testing.
