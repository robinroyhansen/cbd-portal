[Browse all studies](/research)*\n\n## Quick Summary\n\nNerolidol is a sesquiterpene with a woody, floral, citrus aroma found in ginger, jasmine, and [cannabis](/glossary/cannabis). Known for sedative properties, skin penetration enhancement, and potential antiparasitic effects, nerolidol is particularly valuable in CBD products designed for [sleep](/conditions/sleep) and topical applications.\n\n---\n\n## Key Numbers: Nerolidol Effects & Dosing\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Onset time (inhaled) | 5-15 minutes |\n| Onset time (oral) | 30-90 minutes |\n| Typical strain content | 0.1-0.5% of total terpenes |\n| Micro-dose range | 1-2.5mg CBD |\n\nThese timing and dosage figures reflect typical ranges for nerolidol-containing CBD products, with onset varying significantly based on consumption method and individual metabolism.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Woody, floral aroma with fresh bark and citrus notes\n- Significant sedative and relaxing properties\n- Enhances skin penetration of other compounds\n- Potential antiparasitic and antimicrobial effects\n- Found in ginger, jasmine, tea tree, and cannabis\n\n---\n\n## What Is Nerolidol?\n\nNerolidol (also called peruviol) is a sesquiterpene [alcohol](/conditions/alcohol) found in many flowers and plants. It exists in two forms (cis and trans) with slightly different properties.\n\nNatural sources:\n- **Neroli (orange blossoms)** — Named for this source\n- **Ginger** — Contributing to complex aroma\n- **Jasmine** — Floral component\n- **Tea tree** — Part of medicinal profile\n- **Cannabis** — Present in various strains\n\n---\n\n## Nerolidol's Effects and Benefits\n\n### Sedative Properties\n\nResearch indicates:\n- Significant sedative effects in animal studies\n- May promote relaxation and sleep\n- Potential anxiolytic properties\n- Useful for evening/nighttime products\n\n### Penetration Enhancement\n\nImportant for [topicals](/glossary/topicals):\n- Increases skin absorption of other compounds\n- May enhance [bioavailability](/glossary/bioavailability) of CBD in topicals\n- Valued in transdermal formulations\n\n### Antimicrobial and Antiparasitic\n\nStudies show:\n- Activity against various pathogens\n- Antiparasitic properties (malaria research)\n- Potential antifungal effects\n\n---\n\n## Nerolidol in CBD Products\n\nParticularly valuable in:\n- Sleep-focused CBD products\n- Topical formulations\n- Evening tinctures\n- [Full-spectrum](/glossary/full-spectrum) products with sedating profiles\n\n---\n\n## My Take\n\nNerolidol is underappreciated but potentially very useful. Its sedative effects complement CBD's relaxing properties, and its skin penetration enhancement makes it ideal for topicals. If you're using CBD for sleep or topically for localised issues, products with notable nerolidol content may provide enhanced effects. The woody, floral aroma is also simply pleasant.\n\n---\n\n## Related Articles\n\n- [What Are Terpenes?](/knowledge/what-are-terpenes-guide)\n- [Best Terpenes for Sleep](/knowledge/best-terpenes-for-sleep)\n- [CBD Topicals Guide](/products/cbd-topicals-guide)\n\n---\n\n*This article is for educational purposes only.*\n---\n\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### How long does it take for nerolidol's sedative effects to kick in?\n\nWhen inhaled or vaped, nerolidol's calming effects typically begin within 5-15 minutes due to rapid absorption through the lungs. With oral consumption (edibles, tinctures), expect onset between 30-90 minutes as the compound must be processed through digestion. Individual metabolism, dosage, and whether taken with food can significantly influence timing.\n\n### Can I use nerolidol-rich CBD products during the day without feeling drowsy?\n\nNerolidol has pronounced sedative properties that can cause drowsiness, especially in higher concentrations. For daytime use, choose products with lower nerolidol content or smaller doses. Many users find micro-dosing (1-2.5mg CBD) with nerolidol-containing products provides relaxation without excessive sleepiness, but individual sensitivity varies considerably.\n\n### Which cannabis strains are highest in nerolidol content?\n\nSweet Skunk, Skywalker OG, and Island Sweet Skunk typically contain the highest nerolidol levels, often ranging from 0.1-0.5% of total terpene content. Jack Herer and some Purple strains also show notable nerolidol concentrations. However, terpene profiles vary significantly between growers, harvest times, and curing methods, so lab testing is the only reliable way to confirm levels.\n\n### Does nerolidol help CBD topicals work better for [pain](/conditions/pain) relief?\n\nNerolidol's penetration-enhancing properties can increase how much CBD and other cannabinoids absorb through the skin, potentially improving therapeutic effects. Studies suggest it may increase skin permeability by 3-5 times for certain compounds. This makes nerolidol particularly valuable in [arthritis](/conditions/arthritis) creams, muscle balms, and localized pain relief products where deeper tissue penetration is desired.\n\n### Are there any medications that interact negatively with nerolidol?\n\nNerolidol may enhance the sedative effects of sleep medications, benzodiazepines, and alcohol, potentially causing excessive drowsiness. It could also theoretically interact with [blood thinners](/conditions/blood-thinners) due to its mild anticoagulant properties, though human studies are limited. Always consult your healthcare provider before combining nerolidol-containing products with [prescription medications](/conditions/prescription-meds), especially CNS depressants.\n\n## Related Studies\n\nResearch related to this topic:\n\n- [Transdermal Delivery of Anionic Nanoparticles of Resveratrol, Cannabidiol, Pacli...
