## 1. BRAND VOICE & TONE

### 1.1 Core Positioning

CBD Portal is the **research-backed, European-focused** CBD information resource. We don't make claims — we show what studies say and help people make informed decisions.

### 1.2 Voice Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Authoritative** | Confident but not arrogant | "Research suggests..." not "CBD definitely..." |
| **Educational** | Teaching, not selling | Explain concepts, don't push products |
| **Accessible** | Expert content for non-experts | Define terms, avoid jargon |
| **Honest** | Acknowledge limitations | "More research is needed" when true |
| **European** | EU/UK focused, not US | Reference EU regulations, not FDA |

### 1.3 What We Say vs Don't Say

| ❌ Don't Say | ✅ Do Say |
|-------------|----------|
| "CBD cures anxiety" | "Research suggests CBD may help reduce anxiety symptoms" |
| "Take 50mg for pain" | "Studies have used doses ranging from 25-150mg for pain" |
| "CBD is completely safe" | "CBD is generally well-tolerated, though side effects can occur" |
| "FDA approved" (for general CBD) | "Epidiolex is approved for specific conditions" |
| "Buy CBD now" | "Learn how to choose quality CBD products" |

### 1.4 Audience Awareness

**Primary audience:** Adults in Europe researching CBD for the first time or seeking deeper information

**Assume the reader:**
- Has heard of CBD but doesn't know details
- Is skeptical of marketing claims
- Wants evidence, not opinions
- May have a specific condition in mind
- Values quality over price

## 3. FEATURED SNIPPET OPTIMIZATION

### 3.1 Quick Answer Box Rules

Every article starts with a Quick Answer box designed to win Position 0.

**Format requirements:**
- 40-60 words (Google's preferred length)
- Directly answers the title question
- No hedging or "it depends" as first words
- Includes primary keyword
- Standalone paragraph (not part of intro)

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad Quick Answer:**
> "It depends on various factors. CBD might help some people with anxiety, but research is still ongoing and results vary from person to person."

✅ **Good Quick Answer:**
> "CBD may help reduce anxiety by interacting with serotonin receptors in the brain. Research shows doses of 25-600mg have reduced anxiety in clinical studies, with 300mg showing particular promise. Most people notice effects within 30-60 minutes when taken sublingually."

### 3.2 Definition Snippets

For "What is X?" articles, structure the answer for definition snippets:

```markdown
## What is CBD?

**CBD (cannabidiol)** is a naturally occurring compound found in hemp 
plants. Unlike THC, CBD is non-intoxicating, meaning it won't get you 
high. It interacts with the body's endocannabinoid system and is 
commonly used for anxiety, pain, and sleep support.
```

Key elements:
- Bold the term being defined
- Keep definition to 40-50 words
- Include key differentiators
- Mention common uses

### 3.3 List Snippets

For "best," "types of," or "ways to" queries:

```markdown
## Types of CBD Products

The main types of CBD products include:

1. **CBD Oil/Tinctures** — liquid drops taken under the tongue
2. **CBD Gummies** — edible candies infused with CBD
3. **CBD Capsules** — pre-measured pills swallowed with water
4. **CBD Topicals** — creams and balms applied to skin
5. **CBD Vapes** — inhaled CBD for fast effects
```

Key elements:
- Numbered or bulleted list
- Bold key terms
- Brief description after each
- 5-8 items ideal

### 3.4 Table Snippets

For comparison queries:

```markdown
## CBD Oil vs CBD Gummies

| Factor | CBD Oil | CBD Gummies |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Onset time | 15-30 minutes | 30-60 minutes |
| Duration | 4-6 hours | 6-8 hours |
| Bioavailability | 20-30% | 10-20% |
| Taste | Earthy/hemp | Flavored |
| Dosing precision | High | Medium |
| Convenience | Medium | High |
```

## 4. RESEARCH INTEGRATION

### 4.1 The CBD Portal Research Advantage

We have 698 studies in our database. **Every article should leverage this.**

### 4.2 "What Research Says" Section

Required in all condition and science articles.

**Template:**

```markdown
## What Research Says

Our research database includes [X] studies examining CBD and [topic]. 
Here's what the current evidence suggests:

**Clinical Findings:**

A [year] study published in *[Journal Name]* examined [number] 
participants with [condition]. Researchers found that [specific finding 
with numbers]. [Link to study in research database]

Another study from [year] in *[Journal]* reported [finding]. Participants 
received [dose] of CBD over [duration]. [Link to study]

**What This Means:**

The research suggests CBD may [cautious summary of implications]. However, 
[limitation or caveat].

**Research Gaps:**

More studies are needed to understand [what's unknown]. Most existing 
research [limitation, e.g., "uses small sample sizes" or "is short-term"].

[Explore all [X] studies on [topic] →](/research?condition=[topic])
```

### 4.3 Citing Studies

**In-text citation format:**
> "A 2019 study in The Permanente Journal found that 79% of participants experienced reduced anxiety scores within the first month (Shannon et al., 2019)."

**Link format:**
- Link to our research database page for that study
- If study is in our database: `[study title](/research/[study-id])`
- If referencing generally: `[View related studies](/research?topic=[topic])`

### 4.4 Honest Limitations

Always acknowledge:
- Small sample sizes
- Short study durations
- Lack of long-term data
- Variability in products/doses studied
- Difference between animal and human studies

**Example language:**
> "While these results are promising, it's important to note that most studies are small-scale and short-term. More large-scale, long-term clinical trials are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn."
