My honest advice: if travelling internationally, seriously consider leaving CBD at home unless you've thoroughly verified it's legal at your destination. The risk of customs issues, confiscation, or worse simply isn't worth it in many cases. For domestic travel, keeping original packaging, having your COA accessible, and following liquid rules usually makes things straightforward. When in doubt, don't bring it.\n\n---\n\n## Related Articles\n\n- [CBD Laws Europe](/knowledge/traveling-with-cbd-europe)\n- [Flying with CBD](/knowledge/flying-with-cbd)\n- [Is CBD Legal?](/knowledge/is-cbd-legal)\n\n---\n\n*This article is for educational purposes only. Verify current laws before travelling.*\n\n---\n\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Can I travel internationally with CBD gummies or edibles?\n\nCBD edibles face stricter scrutiny than oils or capsules because they can be mistaken for regular food items containing illegal substances. Many countries have specific prohibitions on cannabis edibles regardless of THC content. Stick to clearly labelled tinctures or capsules with certificates of analysis when crossing borders, as these are easier for customs officials to verify and assess.\n\n### What happens if airport security finds my CBD products?\n\nSecurity agents will typically examine your products, check labels for THC content, and may test them using field kits. If products appear legal and properly documented, you'll usually proceed normally. However, agents may confiscate products if packaging is unclear, lab reports are missing, or THC content is questionable, even if the products are technically legal.\n\n### How much CBD oil can I pack in carry-on luggage?\n\nCBD oils must follow standard liquid restrictions: containers of 100ml or less in your liquids bag for carry-on. Larger bottles must go in checked baggage. Consider bringing smaller travel-sized bottles or transferring oil to compliant containers, but always keep original labels and certificates of analysis with the products for verification.\n\n### Should I declare my CBD products at customs?\n\nDeclaration depends on destination country requirements and product value. While not always mandatory for personal-use quantities in CBD-legal countries, declaring shows transparency and compliance. Always declare if you're unsure about local laws, carrying large quantities, or if customs forms specifically ask about hemp or cannabis products.\n\n### Can I travel with CBD if I have a medical prescription?\n\nA medical prescription doesn't guarantee international travel permission, as CBD laws vary by country regardless of medical need. However, prescriptions do provide additional legitimacy and may help with customs or security questions. Carry official medical documentation alongside your CBD products and research whether your destination recognizes foreign cannabis prescriptions.\n\n## Related Studies\n\nResearch related to this topic:\n\n- [Transcriptomic Changes and the Roles of Cannabinoid Receptors and PPARγ in Devel...
