Prices vary by product type and concentration, with oils being more affordable than [capsules](/glossary/capsules). Some provinces offer subsidized programs that can reduce costs by 30-50% for low-income patients.\n\n### Can I grow my own CBD plants in Argentina without a medical condition?\n\nPersonal cultivation is only legal for registered REPROCANN patients or their [caregivers](/conditions/caregivers), allowing up to 9 plants for personal use. Growing without medical authorization remains illegal and can result in criminal charges. The medical registry requires documented health conditions and physician approval, making recreational cultivation prohibited under current laws.\n\n### What happens if I get caught with CBD products at Buenos Aires airport?\n\nArgentine customs treats CBD products as controlled substances unless you have proper REPROCANN documentation. Without authorization, products will be confiscated and you may face legal proceedings. Even products legal in your home country are subject to Argentine law, so bringing CBD without medical registration is strongly discouraged.\n\n### Which pharmacies in Buenos Aires sell CBD products to the public?\n\nMajor pharmacy chains like Farmacity and Dr. Ahorro stock some CBD wellness products, though availability varies by location. Products are typically low-concentration (under 150mg per bottle) and marketed as dietary supplements rather than medicine. Always verify [third-party testing](/glossary/third-party-testing) certificates, as regulatory oversight for consumer products remains limited compared to medical cannabis.\n\n### How long does REPROCANN registration take for CBD access?\n\nThe REPROCANN registration process typically takes 30-60 days from application submission to approval. You'll need medical documentation, physician recommendation, and completion of online forms. Once approved, accessing CBD products through authorized channels usually takes an additional 1-2 weeks, though some provinces have faster distribution networks than others.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n- [CBD Laws in South America](/knowledge/cbd-laws-south-america)\n- [Traveling with CBD](/guides/traveling-with-cbd)\n\n---\n\n*This article is for informational purposes only.
