## Quick Summary

CBD shatter is a highly concentrated CBD extract with a glass-like, brittle texture that "shatters" when broken. It's typically 80-90%+ pure CBD, created through an extraction process that removes plant material, waxes, and fats. CBD shatter is primarily used through dabbing or vaporisation and offers a potent, fast-acting CBD experience.

## Key Takeaways

- Highly concentrated (80-90%+ CBD)
- Glass-like, brittle texture
- Consumed via dabbing/vaporising
- Very pure form of CBD
- For experienced users

## What Is CBD Shatter?

### Definition

CBD shatter is a type of CBD concentrate known for its hard, translucent, glass-like appearance. When handled, it breaks or "shatters" into pieces, hence the name.

### Characteristics

**Appearance:**
- Clear to amber colour
- Translucent
- Glass-like texture
- Breaks into shards

**Potency:**
- 80-99% cannabinoids typical
- Primarily CBD
- Very concentrated
- Small amounts needed

## How CBD Shatter Is Made

### Extraction Process

**1. Initial Extraction:**
- BHO (Butane Hash Oil) method common
- CO2 extraction also used
- CBD extracted from hemp

**2. Purging:**
- Solvents removed
- Vacuum purging
- Heat applied carefully

**3. Cooling:**
- Controlled cooling process
- Creates glass-like structure
- No agitation (creates shatter vs wax)

### Why It's Different from Other Concentrates

**Key Difference:**
The cooling process without agitation creates the glass-like structure. If agitated during cooling, it would become wax or crumble instead.

## CBD Shatter vs. Other Concentrates

### Comparison

| Concentrate | Texture | CBD % | Process Difference |
|-------------|---------|-------|-------------------|
| Shatter | Glass-like | 80-99% | No agitation cooling |
| Wax | Soft, waxy | 80-90% | Agitated during cooling |
| Crumble | Dry, crumbly | 80-90% | More agitation |
| Distillate | Thick liquid | 90-99% | Further distillation |

### Why Choose Shatter?

- Very pure
- Easy to handle
- Stable at room temperature
- Long shelf life
- Precise portioning

## How to Use CBD Shatter

### Dabbing

**Most Common Method:**
1. Heat dab nail/banger
2. Let cool slightly
3. Apply small amount of shatter
4. Inhale vapour
5. Use carb cap if desired

**Equipment Needed:**
- Dab rig
- Dab nail/banger
- Torch (or e-nail)
- Dab tool

### Vaporising

**Alternative Method:**
- Use concentrate-compatible vaporiser
- Set appropriate temperature
- Load small amount
- Inhale vapour

### Adding to Flower

**Combination Use:**
- Crumble shatter pieces
- Mix with CBD flower
- Smoke or vaporise
- Increases potency

## Dosing CBD Shatter

### Start Very Small

**Because It's Concentrated:**
- Tiny amounts needed
- Rice grain size or less
- 10-25mg CBD in small piece
- Observe before re-dosing

### Calculating

**Example:**
- Shatter is 85% CBD
- 50mg piece contains ~42.5mg CBD
- Much stronger than oil
- Adjust accordingly

### Potency Warning

CBD shatter is extremely concentrated. New users should start with minimal amounts and increase gradually.

## Comparing CBD Delivery

### Shatter vs. Oil

| Factor | Shatter | CBD Oil |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Potency | Very high | Variable |

## My Take

CBD shatter is for experienced concentrate users who want the most potent, pure form of CBD and have proper equipment. It's not practical for most people—CBD oil offers convenience and controlled dosing that shatter can't match. But for those who appreciate concentrates, quality CBD shatter provides an extremely pure, fast-acting experience. Just make sure to verify lab testing, especially for residual solvents, and start with tiny amounts.
