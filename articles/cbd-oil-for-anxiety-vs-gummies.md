## Quick Summary

For anxiety specifically, CBD oil (sublingual) may have advantages over gummies due to faster onset and higher bioavailability. When anxiety strikes, waiting 30-90 minutes for gummies to work can be challenging. Sublingual oil works in 15-30 minutes. However, gummies are better for predictable daily use. The best choice depends on whether you need fast relief or steady daily support.

## My Take

For anxiety specifically, I lean toward recommending oil as the primary format—the faster onset matters when anxiety appears. But I also recognise that gummies are more practical for many situations and better for building a consistent daily routine. The ideal for many anxiety sufferers is both: gummies for daily prevention and oil for when anxiety breaks through. If you must choose one, base it on your anxiety pattern: acute episodes favour oil; general daily anxiety favours gummies.
