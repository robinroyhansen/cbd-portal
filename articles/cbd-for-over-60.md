## My Take

CBD can be valuable for adults over 60, but the approach must be more careful than for younger people. The key issues are medication interactions (especially blood thinners) and increased sensitivity. Work with your healthcare provider, start at half the normal adult dose, and increase very slowly. Many seniors use CBD successfully and safely—but those who do best are the ones who approach it carefully and keep their healthcare team informed.
