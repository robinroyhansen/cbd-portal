## The Biphasic Response

## My Take

Most people benefit from a twice-daily CBD routine—morning for setting a calm foundation, evening for sleep support and decompression. But your specific goals should drive your timing.

If you can only take CBD once, choose based on your primary need. Sleep issues? Evening. Daytime anxiety? Morning. If you're not sure, experiment with both times and track what works. The "best" time is the one that addresses your specific concerns.
