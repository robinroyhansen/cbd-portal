## Common Questions

2. **Transfers to** breast milk
3. **Effects on infants** unknown

## My Take

I know postpartum can be incredibly challenging, and CBD might seem like an attractive natural option. But we don't know how CBD affects developing infants, and the precautionary principle applies.

It's a temporary sacrifice. Once you've finished breastfeeding, you can resume CBD use. Until then, work with your healthcare provider to find safe alternatives for whatever symptoms you're managing.
