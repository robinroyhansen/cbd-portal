### Endocannabinoid System

Role:
- CB receptors in gut
- Affects gut motility
- Influences visceral pain
- Theoretical basis

### Research Status

Evidence:
- Limited IBS-specific studies
- Theoretical basis strong
- Anecdotal reports
- More research needed

- Track food and stress triggers too
- Give it several weeks

### Timing

Options:
- Daily consistent use
- Before stressful situations
- With meals if tolerated
- Find what works

### Which IBS Type

## Key Takeaways

1. **Theoretical basis** for CBD in IBS
2. **Gut-brain connection** relevant
3. **May help** pain and anxiety component
4. **Limited research** currently
5. **Part of comprehensive** approach

## My Take

IBS is where CBD's effects on both gut and brain become particularly interesting. Since stress is such a major trigger for IBS, CBD's anxiety-reducing properties alone might help many sufferers.

Don't expect CBD to replace dietary management or other IBS strategies. But as part of a comprehensive approach including diet, stress management, and lifestyle factors, CBD might provide additional support.
