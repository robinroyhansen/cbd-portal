## Quick Summary

CBD can come from hemp or marijuana plants—the molecule is identical, but the source matters for legality, THC content, and availability. Understanding this distinction is essential for informed purchasing.

## The Same Molecule

### CBD Is CBD

Important fact:
- CBD molecule is identical regardless of source
- Same chemical structure
- Same effects on the body
- Source doesn't change the CBD itself

### Why Source Matters

Despite same molecule:
- Legal status differs dramatically
- THC content varies
- Product availability differs
- Testing and quality vary

## Hemp-Derived CBD

### What Is Hemp?

Definition:
- Cannabis with <0.3% THC (US definition)
- Grown for fiber, seeds, and CBD
- Federally legal in US (2018 Farm Bill)
- Most CBD products come from hemp

### Advantages

Benefits:
- Federally legal in US
- Widely available
- Low/no THC
- Can ship across state lines
- Drug test safer

### Considerations

Know that:
- May have trace THC (<0.3%)
- Full-spectrum has some THC
- Isolate products THC-free
- Quality varies by producer

## Marijuana-Derived CBD

### What Is Marijuana?

Definition:
- Cannabis with >0.3% THC
- Higher THC content
- Still federally illegal (US)
- Legal in some states

### Advantages

Potential benefits:

- Higher cannabinoid diversity sometimes
- Available in legal cannabis states
- Medical programs may offer

### Significant Limitations

Major concerns:

- Legal risk outside legal states

---

## Legal Differences

### Hemp-Derived (US)

Legal status:
- Federally legal under Farm Bill
- State laws vary (most allow)
- Can ship nationwide
- Available online and retail

### Marijuana-Derived (US)

- Isolate: pure CBD, no THC
- Choose based on needs

### Marijuana-Derived Products

THC levels:

## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD molecule is identical** from either source
2. **Hemp-derived is federally legal** (US)
3. **Marijuana-derived is not** federally legal
4. **Hemp CBD works** for most purposes
5. **Choose based on** legality and THC needs

---

## My Take

For the vast majority of people, hemp-derived CBD is the practical choice. It's federally legal, widely available, and comes in various THC levels (including THC-free). The CBD molecule itself is identical regardless of source.

Marijuana-derived CBD makes sense only in specific situations—living in a legal state, wanting dispensary products, or being under medical supervision. For most users seeking CBD's benefits, hemp-derived products provide everything needed with better legal certainty.
