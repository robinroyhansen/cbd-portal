## Quick Summary

Natural CBD oil has an earthy, herbal, slightly bitter taste that many describe as "grassy" or "nutty." The flavour comes from the hemp plant, terpenes, and carrier oil. Many products come flavoured to mask this taste, and some formats (capsules, gummies) avoid the taste entirely.

## My Take

The natural taste of CBD is admittedly not for everyone—that earthy, grassy flavour takes getting used to. But you have options: flavoured oils, gummies, capsules. Don't let taste concerns stop you from trying CBD. Find the format that works for you, and know that many people who initially disliked it eventually don't mind (or even appreciate) the natural taste.
