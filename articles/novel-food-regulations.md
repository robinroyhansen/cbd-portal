## What Are Novel Foods?

### Definition

## The Authorisation Process

### Steps Required

1. Submit application to EU member state
2. Safety assessment by EFSA
3. Review by European Commission
4. Authorisation decision
5. Product can be legally sold

### Challenges

- Expensive (hundreds of thousands of euros)
- Time-consuming (18+ months)
- Requires extensive safety data
- Many applications pending

---

## Current Market Reality

### Legal Situation

- Many products on market without authorisation
- Enforcement varies by country
- Large backlog of applications
- Uncertainty for consumers and businesses

### What This Means for Consumers

- Products from established brands generally safer
- Look for companies with Novel Food applications
- Regulations protect consumer safety
- Market consolidation likely

## My Take

Novel Food regulations make the EU CBD market complex. While intended to ensure safety, they've created uncertainty. Until more authorisations are granted, buying from reputable brands with pending applications is the pragmatic approach.
