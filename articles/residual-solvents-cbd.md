## Quick Summary

Residual solvents are chemicals left over from the CBD extraction process. While most are removed during purification, improper processing can leave harmful solvent residues. Quality products are tested to ensure solvent levels are safe or undetectable.

## Key Takeaways

- Solvents used to extract CBD from hemp
- Proper processing removes most residue
- Some solvents more dangerous than others
- CO2 extraction avoids solvent concerns
- Testing verifies safe levels

## Understanding Extraction Solvents

### Why Solvents Are Used

Solvents dissolve cannabinoids:
- Separate CBD from plant material
- Enable efficient extraction
- Allow for concentration
- Various methods available

### Common Extraction Solvents

- Ethanol (food-grade alcohol)
- Butane/Propane (hydrocarbons)
- CO2 (supercritical)
- Hexane
- Isopropyl alcohol

---

## Solvent Classification

### Class 1 (Avoid)

**Most Dangerous:**
- Benzene
- Carbon tetrachloride
- 1,2-Dichloroethane

**Should NEVER be present**
- Known carcinogens
- Highly toxic
- Not used by reputable extractors

### Class 2 (Limit)

**Moderate Concern:**
- Hexane
- Methanol
- Acetonitrile
- Chloroform

**Strict limits apply:**
- Can cause health effects
- Some used in processing
- Should be minimised

### Class 3 (Lower Risk)

**Less Toxic:**
- Ethanol
- Acetone
- Isopropanol
- Butane/Propane

**Higher limits acceptable:**
- Lower toxicity
- Commonly used
- Still should be removed

## Extraction Methods Compared

### CO2 Extraction

**Solvent Concern:** None

**Advantages:**
- No solvent residue possible
- Clean, pure product
- Industry gold standard
- Premium method

**Considerations:**
- Higher equipment cost
- Still verify with testing

### Ethanol Extraction

**Solvent Concern:** Low

**Advantages:**
- Food-grade solvent
- Efficient extraction
- Easily purged
- Cost-effective

**Residue Risk:**
- Generally safe
- Higher limits acceptable
- Should still be minimised

### Hydrocarbon Extraction

**Solvent Concern:** Moderate

**Solvents Used:**
- Butane
- Propane
- Both/blends

**Residue Risk:**
- Requires thorough purging
- Can be very clean if done properly
- Testing essential

### Other Solvents

**Higher Concern:**
- Hexane extraction
- Isopropyl methods
- Less common commercially
- Stricter limits needed

---

## Safe Limits

### General Guidelines

| Solvent | Typical Limit |
|---------|---------------|
| Butane | <5000 ppm |
| Propane | <5000 ppm |
| Ethanol | <5000 ppm |
| Isopropanol | <5000 ppm |
| Hexane | <290 ppm |
| Methanol | <3000 ppm |

*Limits vary by jurisdiction*

### "ND" vs Safe Limits

- "ND" (not detected) is ideal
- Below limits is acceptable
- Near limits raises questions
- Above limits is fail

---

## Health Effects of Exposure

### Short-Term

- Respiratory irritation
- Headaches
- Dizziness
- Nausea

### Chronic Exposure

- Depends on solvent type
- Neurological effects possible
- Some are carcinogenic
- Organ damage (high levels)

---

## How to Verify Safety

### Check the COA For

1. Residual solvents panel
2. List of solvents tested
3. Results for each solvent
4. "Pass" or "ND" status
5. Limits used

### Quality Indicators

**Good:**
- All solvents "ND"
- Comprehensive panel
- CO2 extraction noted
- Third-party tested

**Concerning:**
- Missing solvent testing
- Detections near limits
- Limited panel
- No extraction method stated

---

## Questions for Companies

- What extraction method do you use?
- Do you test for residual solvents?
- Can I see the full solvent panel?
- What are your acceptable limits?

---

## My Take

Residual solvent testing is a basic quality requirement. Reputable extractors purge solvents properly and verify with testing. CO2 extraction eliminates this concern entirely, which is one reason it's preferred. If a company can't tell you their extraction method and show solvent testing, look elsewhere.
