## My Take

Burnout is increasingly common, and CBD can help manage the stress response and sleep disruption that come with it. But CBD alone won't solve burnout—you need to address what's causing it.

Use CBD as support while you make necessary changes: setting boundaries, reducing demands, or even changing your situation. Recovery from burnout takes time and often requires significant life adjustments.
