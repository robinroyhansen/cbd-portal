## My Take

Golf and CBD are a natural fit. The game demands hours of sustained focus and calm under pressure—exactly what CBD may support. Many golfers find that low-dose CBD helps with first-tee nerves without any impairment to their swing or judgment.

The physical benefits matter too. Walking 18 holes and repeating the swing motion creates aches that CBD's anti-inflammatory properties may address.
