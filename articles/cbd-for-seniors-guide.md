## My Take

CBD offers genuine potential for seniors dealing with pain, sleep issues, and anxiety. Many older adults find it helpful as a complement to their wellness routine. But the medication interaction concern is real—more seniors take multiple medications, and those interactions need attention.

The key is working with healthcare providers, starting low, and being patient. Many seniors do well with CBD, but it requires more careful implementation than for younger adults. Take the time to do it right.
