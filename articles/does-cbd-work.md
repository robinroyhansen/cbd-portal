## Quick Summary

Yes, CBD works—but with important caveats. Strong clinical evidence supports CBD for epilepsy, moderate evidence exists for anxiety, and research continues for other uses. Individual responses vary significantly, and CBD isn't a miracle cure. Setting realistic expectations is key.

---

## Key Takeaways

- FDA-approved for epilepsy (proven to work)
- Promising evidence for anxiety
- Mixed evidence for pain and sleep
- Individual responses vary greatly
- Not a cure-all despite marketing claims

---

## Where CBD Definitely Works

### Epilepsy (Strong Evidence)

**FDA-Approved Uses:**
- Dravet syndrome
- Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
- Tuberous sclerosis complex

**The Evidence:**
- Multiple large clinical trials
- 40%+ seizure reduction
- Epidiolex approved 2018
- Pharmaceutical-grade CBD

---

## Where CBD Likely Helps

### Anxiety (Moderate Evidence)

**Research Shows:**
- Multiple human studies positive
- 300-600mg doses studied
- Effects on brain regions confirmed
- Public speaking anxiety reduced

**Reality:**
- Not as strong as epilepsy evidence
- More research needed
- May work for some, not all

---

## Where Evidence Is Mixed

### Pain

- Strong preclinical data
- Limited human trials
- Consumer reports positive
- More research needed

### Sleep

- May help via anxiety reduction
- Dose-dependent effects
- Some positive studies
- Not proven sleep aid

---

## Why CBD Might Not Work For You

### Common Reasons

1. **Dose too low** — Many start too low
2. **Wrong product** — Quality matters
3. **Unrealistic expectations** — Not a miracle
4. **Individual biology** — Genetics affect response
5. **Wrong product type** — Delivery matters
6. **Not enough time** — Some effects take weeks

## The Placebo Question

### Honest Assessment

- Placebo effects are real
- Contribute to all treatments
- Don't invalidate benefits
- CBD exceeds placebo in trials (epilepsy, anxiety)

---

## What "Working" Means

### Realistic Expectations

**CBD May:**
- Take the edge off
- Support overall wellness
- Complement other approaches
- Provide subtle improvements

**CBD Won't:**
- Cure diseases
- Replace necessary medication
- Work for everyone
- Produce dramatic overnight changes

---

## My Take

CBD works—the epilepsy approval proves it can meet rigorous standards. For other uses, evidence is developing. Many people genuinely benefit, but it's not universal. Try it with realistic expectations, give it adequate time (2-4 weeks), use quality products, and track your response objectively.
