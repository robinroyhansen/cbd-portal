## Quick Answer

CBD is **legal in South Africa** when containing less than 0.001% THC (or 0.0075% for certain preparations). Following a landmark 2018 Constitutional Court ruling that decriminalized private cannabis use, South Africa has developed regulations for CBD products. Products are available over-the-counter, though the market is still maturing.

## My Take

South Africa offers an accessible CBD market following its progressive cannabis reforms. The availability in major cities like Johannesburg and Cape Town is good, with health shops and pharmacies carrying products.

The THC limits are among the strictest globally, which means most products are essentially isolate or very highly refined. This differs from markets where full-spectrum products are common.

Quality varies in this developing market, so research brands before purchasing. The best South African CBD companies provide lab testing and clear labeling.
