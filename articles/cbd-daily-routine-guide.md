## My Take

The people who get the most from CBD tend to use it consistently rather than occasionally. Building it into your daily routine—attached to habits you already have—makes this sustainable and lets you actually evaluate whether it's helping.

Start simple: once or twice daily at consistent times. Track what you notice over a few weeks. Then adjust timing and doses based on what you learn. The goal is a routine that works for your life and your goals.
