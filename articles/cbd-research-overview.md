## Quick Summary

CBD research has expanded dramatically, with thousands of studies examining its effects. Strong evidence supports CBD for certain epilepsies (FDA/EMA approved), moderate evidence exists for anxiety and pain, and preliminary research explores many other applications. Understanding research levels helps set realistic expectations.

## Key Takeaways

- Strongest evidence: Epilepsy (FDA-approved Epidiolex)
- Moderate evidence: Anxiety, pain, sleep
- Preliminary: Many other conditions
- Research quality varies significantly
- Human trials lag behind animal studies

## Evidence Levels by Condition

### Strong Evidence

**Epilepsy:**
- Epidiolex approved by FDA (2018) and EMA
- Multiple randomised controlled trials
- Reduces seizures in Dravet, Lennox-Gastaut, Tuberous Sclerosis
- This is the gold standard for CBD research

### Moderate Evidence

**Anxiety:**
- Multiple human trials (mostly small)
- Consistent positive results
- Various anxiety types studied
- Mechanism well-understood (5-HT1A)

**Pain/Inflammation:**
- Strong preclinical evidence
- Limited human trials
- Combination products (CBD+THC) better studied
- More research needed

### Preliminary Evidence

**Many conditions under investigation:**
- Depression
- Sleep disorders
- PTSD
- Addiction
- Neuroprotection
- Skin conditions

## Research Challenges

### Why Evidence Is Limited

- Cannabis scheduling hindered research
- Funding limitations
- Product standardisation issues
- Regulatory complexity
- Long study timelines

### Quality Concerns

- Many studies are small
- Short duration common
- Inconsistent products used
- Publication bias exists

---

## Reading Research Critically

### What to Look For

- Study type (RCT is gold standard)
- Sample size
- Duration
- Dosing protocol
- Funding source

### Hierarchy of Evidence

From strongest to weakest:
1. Meta-analyses of RCTs
2. Randomised controlled trials
3. Observational studies
4. Animal studies
5. In vitro (cell) studies
6. Case reports/anecdotes

## My Take

CBD research is real but nuanced. The epilepsy evidence is pharmaceutical-grade solid. Anxiety evidence is promising and consistent. Beyond that, we're often working with preliminary data. This doesn't mean CBD doesn't work for other conditions—absence of proof isn't proof of absence. But it means expectations should be calibrated to evidence levels.
