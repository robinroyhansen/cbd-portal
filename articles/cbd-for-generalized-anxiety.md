## Key Takeaways

1. **GAD is chronic** excessive worry
2. **CBD may help** reduce anxiety levels
3. **Daily use** likely most effective
4. **Works best** with other approaches
5. **Give it time** to assess effectiveness

## My Take

Living with GAD means managing a constant undercurrent of worry. CBD might help dial down that background anxiety, making everything else more manageable. The research is promising, though we need more GAD-specific studies.

My suggestion: try CBD as part of a broader approach that includes stress management and possibly therapy. Give it several weeks of consistent use to fairly assess whether it helps your particular anxiety pattern.
