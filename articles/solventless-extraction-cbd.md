## Key Takeaways

- No chemical solvents used
- Mechanical/physical processes only
- No residual solvent concerns
- Lower yields typically
- Premium quality possible

## Common Solventless Methods

### Rosin Press

**Process:**
- Heat and pressure applied to hemp
- Resin squeezed out
- No solvents involved
- Immediate usable product

**Advantages:**
- Truly solvent-free
- Preserves terpenes
- Simple process
- Full spectrum

### Ice Water Extraction

**Process:**
- Hemp mixed with ice water
- Trichomes become brittle
- Agitation separates trichomes
- Filtered and dried

**Produces:**
- Bubble hash
- Can be further refined
- Pure trichome heads
- Traditional method

### Dry Sifting

**Process:**
- Hemp material sifted through screens
- Trichomes separated mechanically
- Multiple screen grades
- Produces kief/dry sift
