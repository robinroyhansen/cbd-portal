## Quick Summary

CBD transdermal patches deliver cannabinoids through the skin into the bloodstream over extended periods. Unlike regular topicals that work locally, patches provide systemic effects similar to oral CBD. Here's how they work and whether they're right for you.

## How Transdermal Patches Work

### The Technology

Mechanism:
- Adhesive patch applied to skin
- CBD formulated to penetrate skin barrier
- Enters bloodstream through dermis
- Provides steady release over hours

### Transdermal vs Topical

Key difference:
- **Topicals:** Work locally at application site
- **Transdermal:** Enter bloodstream for systemic effects
- Patches use permeation enhancers
- Different intended purposes

## Key Takeaways

1. **Patches deliver CBD** through skin to bloodstream
2. **Steady release** over extended periods
3. **Different from topicals** (systemic vs local)
4. **Convenient** but typically more expensive
5. **Good for all-day** consistent coverage

## My Take

Transdermal patches are an underrated CBD delivery method. The steady, all-day release is genuinely useful for people who want consistent effects without remembering multiple doses. The convenience factor is high.

The downsides are cost and slower onset. If you need quick effects or are price-conscious, patches may not be the best choice. But for busy people who want set-and-forget CBD delivery, patches are worth trying.
