## Quick Answer

Delta-9-THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) is the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis—the molecule responsible for the "high." It works by binding directly to [CB1 receptors](/glossary/cb1-receptor) in the brain. While CBD and delta-9-THC come from the same plant, they have very different effects. Legal CBD products typically contain less than 0.3% delta-9-THC, which is not enough to cause intoxication.

## What is Delta-9-THC?

Delta-9-THC is one of over 100 [cannabinoids](/glossary/cannabinoid) found in the cannabis plant. The "delta-9" refers to the position of a double bond in its molecular structure, which distinguishes it from other THC variants like [delta-8-THC](/knowledge/what-is-delta-8-thc).

**Key characteristics:**
- Chemical formula: C₂₁H₃₀O₂
- Molecular weight: 314.5 g/mol
- Primary psychoactive cannabinoid in cannabis
- Naturally produced by the cannabis plant
- Regulated as a controlled substance in most countries

## How Delta-9-THC Works

Delta-9-THC produces its effects primarily through the [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system):

**CB1 receptor binding:** Delta-9-THC is a partial agonist at CB1 receptors, meaning it directly activates these receptors. CB1 receptors are concentrated in the brain, which explains the psychoactive effects.

**CB2 receptor interaction:** THC also binds to CB2 receptors, which are primarily found in the immune system, contributing to its anti-inflammatory properties.

**Mimics anandamide:** Delta-9-THC mimics [anandamide](/glossary/anandamide), a natural endocannabinoid your body produces. This similarity allows THC to activate the same receptors.

## Effects of Delta-9-THC

### Psychoactive Effects
- Euphoria ("high")
- Altered time perception
- Increased sensory perception
- Relaxation
- Increased appetite ("munchies")
- Impaired memory and coordination

### Potential Therapeutic Effects
Research suggests delta-9-THC may help with:
- Nausea and vomiting (FDA-approved for chemotherapy)
- Appetite stimulation (FDA-approved for AIDS wasting)
- Pain management
- Muscle spasticity
- Glaucoma (short-term pressure reduction)

### Possible Side Effects
- Anxiety and paranoia (especially at high doses)
- Dry mouth and eyes
- Increased heart rate
- Short-term memory impairment
- Coordination issues
- Psychological dependence with chronic use

## Delta-9-THC vs CBD

| Property | Delta-9-THC | CBD |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| Psychoactive | Yes | No |
| CB1 binding | Direct (agonist) | Indirect (modulator) |
| Legal status | Controlled | Legal (if <0.3% THC) |
| Drug test | Causes positive | May cause positive |
| Intoxicating | Yes | No |

CBD actually moderates some of THC's effects by acting as a negative allosteric modulator at CB1 receptors.

## Delta-9-THC vs Delta-8-THC

[Delta-8-THC](/knowledge/delta-8-vs-delta-9) is a structural isomer with similar but milder effects:

- Delta-8 is less potent (roughly 50-70% as strong)
- Delta-8 may cause less anxiety
- Both are psychoactive
- Legal status varies

---

## Legal Status

Delta-9-THC is controlled differently than CBD:

**United States:** Federally illegal, though legal for adult use in some states. Hemp-derived products must contain <0.3% delta-9-THC by dry weight.

**European Union:** Generally illegal except for medical use in some countries. Legal CBD products must contain minimal THC (varies by country).

**Important:** Always check local laws, as THC regulations vary significantly.

## Delta-9-THC in CBD Products

Legal CBD products contain trace amounts of delta-9-THC:

- **Full-spectrum CBD:** Contains <0.3% THC (in US)
- **Broad-spectrum CBD:** THC removed, may contain traces
- **CBD isolate:** No detectable THC

These trace amounts are not enough to cause intoxication but may accumulate with heavy use and could potentially appear on drug tests.
