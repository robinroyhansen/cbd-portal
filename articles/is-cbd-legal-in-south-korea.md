## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD is effectively prohibited** in South Korea
2. **No wellness CBD market** exists
3. **Medical cannabis** is very limited
4. **Do NOT bring CBD** — serious risk
5. **Enforcement is real** — tourists have been prosecuted
6. **Cultural attitudes** are serious

## My Take

South Korea is not a CBD-friendly country. Unlike its neighbor Japan (which allows CBD with restrictions), South Korea has no general CBD market and strict enforcement.

If you use CBD at home, simply plan to go without during any time in South Korea. The risk of bringing products—even "legal" products from your country—is not worth the potential consequences. South Korean authorities have prosecuted foreigners for cannabis products.

For those with genuine medical needs, consult a Korean healthcare provider about the very limited medical cannabis options. But for general wellness CBD use, South Korea is a no-go.
