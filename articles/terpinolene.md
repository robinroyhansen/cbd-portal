## My Take

Terpinolene is the wild card of cannabis terpenes—its effects seem paradoxical, and it rarely dominates a profile. But when present, it adds complexity that many users appreciate. If you find certain CBD products have a unique, hard-to-describe quality, terpinolene might be the reason. It's worth exploring for those who haven't found their ideal terpene profile with more common options.
