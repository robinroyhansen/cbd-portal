## My Take

CBD can be a reasonable option for older adults, but it requires more care than for younger people. The key concerns are drug interactions and altered metabolism. Work with healthcare providers, start with lower doses than guidelines suggest, and monitor closely. Many seniors use CBD safely and beneficially, but the "start low, go slow" approach is even more important with age.
