## Quick Summary

CBD can be consumed through sublingual (under tongue), oral (swallowed), topical (on skin), and inhaled (vaping) methods. Each offers different onset times, durations, and bioavailability. Sublingual offers the best balance of speed and efficiency for most users, while edibles provide longest duration and topicals work best for localised concerns.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Sublingual: Best overall balance
- Oral/Edibles: Longest duration
- Inhaled: Fastest but shortest
- Topical: Local effects only
- Method affects how much CBD you absorb

## Methods at a Glance

| Method | Onset | Duration | Bioavailability | Best For |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| Sublingual | 15-30 min | 4-6 hours | 20-35% | Daily use, flexibility |
| Oral/Edibles | 30-90 min | 6-8 hours | 10-20% | Long-lasting effects |
| Inhaled | 1-5 min | 2-3 hours | 30-50% | Fast relief (with caution) |
| Topical | 15-45 min | 4-6 hours local | Local only | Targeted areas |

## Sublingual (Under Tongue)

### How It Works

CBD absorbs through mucous membranes under your tongue, bypassing the digestive system and entering the bloodstream directly.

### Products

- CBD oil drops
- Tinctures
- Sublingual strips
- Sprays

### Pros

- Relatively fast onset (15-30 minutes)
- Good bioavailability (20-35%)
- Flexible dosing
- Easy to adjust
- Reasonable duration

### Cons

- Taste can be strong
- Requires holding under tongue
- Less convenient than capsules
- Measuring required

### Best Practices

- Hold under tongue 60-90 seconds
- Don't eat/drink immediately after
- Use mirror to place drops
- Consistent timing

### Best For

- Daily users
- Those wanting dose flexibility
- Balance of speed and duration
- Most common recommendation

## Oral/Swallowed (Edibles, Capsules)

### How It Works

CBD is digested, processed by the liver (first-pass metabolism), then enters the bloodstream. Takes longer but effects last longer.

### Products

- Capsules and softgels
- Gummies
- Chocolates
- Beverages
- CBD-infused foods

### Pros

- Longest duration (6-8 hours)
- No taste issues
- Pre-measured doses
- Most convenient
- Discreet

### Cons

- Slowest onset (30-90 min)
- Lower bioavailability (10-20%)
- Fixed doses
- First-pass metabolism loss
- Affected by food

### Best Practices

- Take with fatty food for better absorption
- Consistent timing daily
- Allow time for onset
- Don't re-dose too quickly

### Best For

- Those who dislike oil taste
- Need for long-lasting effects
- Convenience prioritised
- Overnight/sleep support

---

## Inhaled (Vaping)

### How It Works

CBD vapour absorbs through the lungs directly into the bloodstream, providing the fastest onset and highest bioavailability.

### Products

- Vape pens
- Vape cartridges
- CBD flower
- Concentrates

### Pros

- Fastest onset (1-5 minutes)
- Highest bioavailability (30-50%)
- Immediate effects
- Good for acute situations

### Cons

- Shortest duration (2-3 hours)
- Respiratory health concerns
- Requires equipment
- Less discreet
- Quality concerns with some products
- Not suitable for everyone

### Best Practices

- Use quality, tested products
- Low temperature preferred
- Don't overuse
- Monitor respiratory health

### Best For

- Those needing fast relief
- Experienced users
- Acute situations
- Not recommended as primary method

### Important Caution

Vaping has potential respiratory risks. Not recommended for those with lung conditions, non-smokers, or as a first choice for new users.

## Topical (Skin Application)

### How It Works

CBD absorbs through the skin to affect localised cannabinoid receptors. Doesn't enter bloodstream significantly.

### Products

- Creams
- Balms
- Salves
- Lotions
- Patches
- Roll-ons

### Pros

- Targeted application
- No systemic effects
- No psychoactive potential
- Can use as needed
- Easy to apply

### Cons

- Local effects only
- Won't help systemic issues
- Absorption variable
- Need to reapply
- Can't measure dose precisely

### Best Practices

- Clean area before application
- Massage in thoroughly
- Reapply as needed
- Keep area covered if desired

### Best For

- Localised discomfort
- Skin concerns
- Targeted relief
- Those who don't want systemic effects

## Comparison Deep Dive

### Bioavailability Explained

**What It Means:**
Percentage of CBD that actually reaches your bloodstream.

| Method | Bioavailability | Effective Dose from 50mg |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Inhaled | 30-50% | 15-25mg |
| Sublingual | 20-35% | 10-17.5mg |
| Oral | 10-20% | 5-10mg |

**Implication:**
Lower bioavailability methods may need higher doses to achieve same effect.

### Speed vs. Duration Trade-off

**General Rule:**
- Faster onset = shorter duration
- Slower onset = longer duration

**Example:**
- Vaping: Works in 5 minutes, lasts 2-3 hours
- Edibles: Work in 60 minutes, last 6-8 hours

### Cost Efficiency

**Per mg Cost Consideration:**
- Higher bioavailability = better value per mg
- But convenience factors matter
- Balance effectiveness with practical use

---

## Combining Methods

### Common Combinations

**Morning + Evening:**
- Sublingual oil in morning
- Edible capsule at night

**Daily + As-Needed:**
- Regular sublingual or oral
- Topical for specific issues

**Layered Approach:**
- Sublingual for systemic
- Topical for localised areas

### Why Combine?

- Different needs at different times
- Cover multiple concerns
- Optimise for lifestyle
- Targeted plus systemic support

## Method Recommendations by Goal

| Goal | Recommended Method |
|------|-------------------|
| General wellness | Sublingual or capsules |
| Sleep support | Capsules or sublingual (evening) |
| Stress management | Sublingual |
| Localised discomfort | Topical |
| Fast acute relief | Sublingual (or vape with caution) |
| Convenience priority | Capsules |
| Taste sensitive | Capsules or gummies |

---

## My Take

For most people, sublingual CBD oil is the best starting point—it offers good bioavailability, flexible dosing, and reasonable onset time. Once you know your dose, you might switch to capsules for convenience or add topicals for targeted use. I generally don't recommend vaping as a first choice due to respiratory considerations, even though it's technically the most efficient. The "best" method is ultimately the one you'll use consistently while meeting your specific needs.
