CBD legality in Cyprus is **complex and restrictive**. Despite being an EU member, Cyprus has historically strict drug policies. CBD products face significant regulatory hurdles, with limited legal clarity and a small market.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Complex and restrictive** environment
2. **Limited market** despite EU membership
3. **Pharmacies** safest but limited option
4. **Tourists** should bring their own (cautiously)
5. **Regulatory clarity lacking**
6. **Not like other EU countries**

## My Take

Cyprus presents one of the more challenging CBD markets within the EU. Despite EU membership, the country's strict historical drug policies mean CBD hasn't developed like in most other member states.

If you're visiting and use CBD, consider bringing a small personal supply of clearly THC-free products—but be aware this carries some uncertainty. The domestic market simply doesn't offer the access you'd find in Malta, Greece, or most Western European countries.
