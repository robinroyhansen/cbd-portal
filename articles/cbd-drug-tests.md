## Quick Summary

Pure CBD should not cause a positive drug test, as standard tests look for THC, not CBD. However, full-spectrum CBD products contain trace THC that can accumulate with heavy use, potentially causing false positives. Use THC-free products if drug testing is a concern.

## Key Takeaways

- Drug tests detect THC, not CBD
- Full-spectrum products contain trace THC
- Heavy use of full-spectrum can cause positives
- Use broad-spectrum or isolate if tested
- Quality testing helps verify THC content

## Understanding Drug Tests

### What They Detect

Standard cannabis drug tests look for:
- THC metabolites (THC-COOH)
- NOT CBD
- Cutoff levels determine positive/negative

### Common Cutoff Levels

- **Standard workplace:** 50 ng/mL
- **Federal/DOT:** 50 ng/mL
- **Lower threshold testing:** 20 ng/mL

## CBD Products and THC Content

### Full-Spectrum

- Contains up to 0.2-0.3% THC (legal limit)
- THC accumulates with regular use
- Risk of positive test with heavy use
- Most effective but least safe for testing

### Broad-Spectrum

- THC removed, other compounds retained
- Should be THC-free
- Lower risk but depends on quality
- Verify with third-party testing

### CBD Isolate

- Pure CBD, no THC
- Lowest risk for drug tests
- May not provide entourage effect
- Safest option for tested individuals

---

## Risk Factors

### Higher Risk

- Full-spectrum products
- High doses (100mg+/day)
- Extended use
- Products without THC testing
- Poor quality control

### Lower Risk

- Broad-spectrum or isolate
- Moderate doses
- Products with verified THC-free COA
- Reputable brands

---

## Protecting Yourself

### If You're Drug Tested

1. Use THC-free products only
2. Verify with third-party COA
3. Check THC is "ND" (not detected)
4. Buy from reputable brands
5. Consider the risk vs benefit

---

## My Take

If your job or freedom depends on passing drug tests, don't risk it with full-spectrum products. Use verified THC-free options or don't use CBD at all. The trace amounts in full-spectrum can accumulate, and "it's just CBD" won't help if you test positive.
