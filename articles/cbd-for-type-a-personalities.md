## My Take

Type A individuals often resist anything that might "slow them down." But chronic stress actually impairs performance—it's just slow enough that you might not notice until burnout hits.

Think of CBD as a recovery tool, like athletes use ice baths or massage. It helps you recover so you can perform better tomorrow. Managing stress isn't weakness; it's optimizing for long-term success. Your drive isn't going anywhere—CBD just helps make it sustainable.
