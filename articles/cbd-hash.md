CBD hash offers a concentrated, full-spectrum experience for those who appreciate traditional cannabis concentrates. It's not for everyone—you need appropriate equipment and some experience with concentrates. The quality varies enormously, so third-party testing is essential. For most people, CBD oil remains more practical. But for experienced users who enjoy the ritual and want a potent, natural product, quality CBD hash is a legitimate option.
