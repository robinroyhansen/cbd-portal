## Quick Summary

Hydrocarbon extraction uses solvents like butane or propane to extract cannabinoids from hemp. When done properly with thorough purging, it produces high-quality extracts. However, improper processing can leave residual solvents, making third-party testing essential.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Uses butane, propane, or blends
- Can produce very pure extracts
- Requires thorough solvent removal
- Testing for residual solvents essential
- Professional equipment needed

---

## How It Works

### The Process

1. Chilled hydrocarbon passes through hemp
2. Cannabinoids and terpenes dissolve
3. Solution collected and processed
4. Solvent purged through heat/vacuum
5. Final extract remains

### Common Solvents

**Butane:**
- Most common hydrocarbon
- Efficient extraction
- Low boiling point
- Requires careful purging

**Propane:**
- Lower boiling point
- Extracts lighter terpenes
- Often used in blends
- Quick evaporation

## Advantages

### Quality Potential

- Preserves terpenes well
- Full-spectrum possible
- High cannabinoid yield
- Flavourful extracts

### Efficiency

- Fast processing
- Scalable
- Cost-effective
- High throughput

---

## Safety Considerations

### Production Risks

- Flammable solvents
- Requires closed-loop systems
- Professional facilities needed
- Regulatory compliance

### Consumer Safety

- Residual solvents if improperly made
- Testing essential
- Quality varies significantly
- Buy from reputable sources

---

## Quality Indicators

### What to Look For

- Residual solvent testing on COA
- "ND" for butane/propane
- Professional manufacturer
- Third-party verification

### Red Flags

- No solvent testing
- Detections near limits
- Unknown manufacturer
- No lab verification

---

## My Take

Hydrocarbon extraction can produce excellent CBD products when done professionally with proper purging and testing. The key is verification—always check COAs for residual solvent testing. Professional extractors achieve "non-detect" levels, making the final product safe.
