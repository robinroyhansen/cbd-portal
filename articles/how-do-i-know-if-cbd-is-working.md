## Quick Summary

CBD effects are often subtle, making it challenging to know if it's working. Track specific symptoms over 2-4 weeks, keep a journal, look for gradual improvements rather than dramatic changes, and consider what you're using CBD for when evaluating effectiveness.

- Effects build gradually
- Changes may be small
- Easy to miss improvements

### The Challenge

- Expecting too much
- Not tracking baseline
- Giving up too soon
- Wrong dose or product

---

## How to Track Effectively

### Keep a Simple Journal

**Record Daily:**
- Dose and timing
- Sleep quality (1-10)
- Target symptom (1-10)
- Mood (1-10)
- Any notes

### Review Weekly

- Look for trends
- Compare to first week
- Note consistent changes
- Adjust if needed

---

## Timeline Expectations

### Week 1

- Establishing baseline
- May notice nothing yet
- Don't increase dose yet
- Just observe and record

### Weeks 2-3

- Effects may emerge
- Subtle changes possible
- Cumulative effects building
- Continue tracking

### Week 4+

- Clearer picture develops
- Can evaluate effectiveness
- Adjust dose if needed
- Make informed decision

---

## Questions to Ask Yourself

### After 2-4 Weeks

1. Is my target symptom better?
2. Has my sleep improved?
3. Do I feel calmer generally?
4. Have others noticed changes?
5. Am I reaching for it less/more?

### Honest Assessment

- Be objective, not hopeful
- Compare to real baseline
- Consider all factors
- It's okay if it's not working

---

## What If You Feel Nothing?

### Possible Reasons

- Dose too low
- Wrong product type
- Need more time
- Individual non-responder
- Unrealistic expectations

### Next Steps

1. Try increasing dose gradually
2. Switch product type
3. Try different brand
4. Consider it may not work for you
5. That's okay—not everyone responds

---

## The "Absence Test"

### How It Works

1. Use CBD consistently for 3-4 weeks
2. Stop for 1 week
3. Notice any difference?
4. Symptoms return = it was helping
5. No change = wasn't doing much

---

## Realistic Expectations

### What Success Looks Like

**Not This:**
- Dramatic overnight change
- Complete symptom elimination
- Feeling "high" or altered

**More Like This:**
- Gradual improvement
- "Taking the edge off"
- Better overall sense
- Subtle but noticeable

---

## My Take

The best way to know if CBD is working is systematic tracking over time. Our memories are unreliable, and expectations bias perception. A simple journal with 1-10 ratings makes patterns visible. Give it a fair trial—4 weeks minimum—and if you don't see improvement, that's valid information too.
