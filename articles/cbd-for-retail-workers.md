## Key Takeaways

1. **Physical demands** need body care focus
2. **Customer interactions** benefit from calm
3. **Recovery** between shifts essential
4. **Budget-friendly** options available
5. **Part of** self-care, not complete solution

## My Take

Retail work is undervalued and physically demanding. Standing all day, managing difficult customers, and working variable schedules takes a real toll. CBD can support the physical recovery that makes this work sustainable and the emotional regulation that customer service requires.

But CBD doesn't fix the structural problems of retail work—understaffing, inadequate breaks, and low recognition. Use it as a personal support tool while also advocating for better working conditions. You deserve more than just survival strategies.
