## Quick Summary

To check CBD potency, compare the CBD amount stated on the product label to the cannabinoid testing section of the Certificate of Analysis (COA). The tested amount should be within 10% of the labeled claim. Legitimate products include batch-specific testing that you can verify using the lot number on your product.

## Key Takeaways

- Compare label to COA results
- Should match within ±10%
- Use batch-specific testing
- Calculate total vs. per serving
- Potency directly affects value

---

## Why Potency Matters

### For Effectiveness

- Know actual dose you're taking
- Consistent dosing possible
- Adjust accurately
- Compare products fairly

### For Value

- Pay for what you get
- Calculate true cost per mg
- Identify under-dosed products
- Make informed purchases

---

## Finding Potency Information

### On the Label

**Look For:**
- Total CBD per bottle (e.g., "1000mg")
- CBD per serving (e.g., "33mg per ml")
- CBD per piece (gummies, capsules)
- Percentage (e.g., "10%")

### On the COA

**Find:**
- Total cannabinoids section
- CBD or Cannabidiol line
- Result in mg/ml or %
- Calculated total

---

## Reading COA Potency Results

### Understanding the Format

**COA May Show:**
- mg/ml (milligrams per milliliter)
- mg/g (milligrams per gram)
- Percentage (%)
- Total mg per container

### Converting Units

**mg/ml to Total:**
```
Total CBD = mg/ml × bottle size (ml)
```

**% to mg/ml:**
```
mg/ml = % × 10
```

**Example:**
- COA shows: 32.5mg/ml
- Bottle size: 30ml
- Total: 32.5 × 30 = 975mg

---

## Step-by-Step Potency Verification

### Step 1: Find Label Claim

**Record:**
- Total CBD stated
- Per-serving amount if listed
- Bottle/container size

### Step 2: Locate COA

**Access Through:**
- QR code on product
- Brand website
- Customer service

### Step 3: Match Batch Number

**Confirm:**
- Product batch/lot number
- Matches COA batch number
- Same product tested

### Step 4: Find CBD Result

**On COA Look For:**
- "CBD" or "Cannabidiol"
- Not "Total Cannabinoids"
- Specific CBD value

### Step 5: Calculate and Compare

**Calculate Total From COA:**
- Convert if needed
- Compare to label

**Acceptable Variance:**
- Within ±10% of label
- Slight over is okay
- Significantly under is concerning

---

## Example Verification

### Label Claims

- Product: CBD Oil
- Total CBD: 1000mg
- Bottle size: 30ml
- Per ml: ~33.3mg

### COA Results

- Batch: LOT2024-125
- CBD: 31.8mg/ml
- Bottle: 30ml
- Total: 31.8 × 30 = 954mg

### Assessment

- Labeled: 1000mg
- Tested: 954mg
- Difference: 4.6% under
- Status: **Acceptable** (within 10%)

---

## Red Flags in Potency

### Major Concerns

**More Than 10% Under:**
- Mislabelling
- Poor quality control
- Consider returning

**No COA Available:**
- Cannot verify
- Claims unsubstantiated
- Avoid product

**Inconsistent Testing:**
- Results vary significantly
- Quality control issues
- Unreliable product

### Minor Concerns

**5-10% Variance:**
- Within normal range
- Manufacturing variation
- Generally acceptable

**Slightly Over:**
- Often fine
- Conservative labelling
- Actually beneficial

---

## Total vs. Per Serving

### Common Confusion

**Total CBD:**
- Entire bottle/container
- What you're buying

**Per Serving:**
- Each dose/dropper
- What you take

### Calculation

```
Per Serving = Total CBD ÷ Number of Servings
```

**Example:**
- 1000mg total
- 30 servings (1ml each)
- Per serving: 33.3mg

---

## Comparing Products by Potency

### Standardised Comparison

**Use mg per ml:**
- Product A: 50mg/ml
- Product B: 33mg/ml
- Product C: 100mg/ml

### Cost Per mg

**Formula:**
```
Cost per mg = Price ÷ Total mg
```

**Comparison:**
- Product A: £60/1500mg = £0.04/mg
- Product B: £40/1000mg = £0.04/mg
- Product C: £100/3000mg = £0.033/mg

Best value: Product C

## Testing Your Own Product

### If Concerned

**Options:**
- Send to independent lab
- Cost: £100-300 typically
- Full analysis available
- Definitive answer

### When Worthwhile

- Large purchase
- Ongoing use
- No COA available
- Quality concerns

---

## Understanding Variance

### Why Products Vary

**Natural Factors:**
- Plant material variation
- Extraction batches
- Testing variation
- Manufacturing tolerances

**Acceptable Variance:**
- ±10% is industry standard
- Slight variations normal
- Consistent within range

### Concerning Variance

- More than 10% under
- Varies between batches significantly
- No explanation from company

---

## Potency vs. Quality

### Different Concepts

**Potency:**
- How much CBD present
- Concentration strength
- What you're paying for

**Quality:**
- Purity and safety
- Contaminant-free
- Proper extraction

### Both Matter

High potency + Poor quality = Not worth it
Low potency + High quality = May be fine, but poor value
Accurate potency + High quality = Ideal

---

## My Take

Checking potency is one of the easiest ways to verify you're getting what you pay for. If a product claims 1000mg CBD, the COA should confirm approximately that amount. If it's 10% or more under, the product is mislabeled—either through poor quality control or intentional deception. This simple check takes five minutes and can save you from wasting money on under-dosed products. Make it part of your buying routine.
