## Quick Answer

Guaiol is a [terpene](/knowledge/what-are-terpenes) alcohol with a woody, piney, rose-like aroma. Unlike most terpenes which are oily, guaiol is a crystalline solid. Derived historically from guaiacum wood (lignum vitae), guaiol research suggests antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and potential anticancer properties.

## A Unique Terpene

Guaiol stands out among terpenes:

**Unusual properties:**
- Crystalline solid, not liquid oil
- Sesquiterpene alcohol structure
- Lower boiling point than expected for its size
- Historical significance in medicine

---

## Historical Background

Guaiol comes from guaiacum (lignum vitae) wood:
- Used since 1500s for syphilis treatment (pre-antibiotics)
- "Holy wood" or "wood of life"
- Traditional remedy in Americas
- Still used in some herbal traditions

While these historical uses don't translate directly to modern applications, they indicate bioactivity.

## My Take

Guaiol is a terpene for the curious—not commonly discussed but scientifically interesting. Its unique crystalline structure and historical medicinal use make it noteworthy. While not a primary consideration when choosing CBD products, guaiol's presence indicates a complex terpene profile that may contribute to overall efficacy through the entourage effect.
