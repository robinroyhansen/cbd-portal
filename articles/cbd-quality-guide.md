## Quick Summary

Quality CBD requires: **third-party lab testing, clear labeling, reputable brand, appropriate pricing, and proper extraction.** Avoid products without lab reports, unrealistic claims, suspiciously low prices, or unclear sourcing. The unregulated market means buyer diligence is essential.

## Why Quality Matters

### The Market Reality

| Issue | Frequency |
|-------|-----------|
| Products with less CBD than labeled | Common |
| Undisclosed THC | Occurs |
| Contaminants (pesticides, metals) | Found |
| No or fake lab reports | Exists |
| Mislabeled products | Common |

### Consequences of Poor Quality

- No therapeutic benefit
- Unexpected THC (drug tests)
- Potential health risks (contaminants)
- Wasted money
- Lost trust in CBD

---

## The Essential Checklist

### Must-Haves

✓ **Third-party lab testing (COA)**
✓ **Clear CBD content labeling**
✓ **Company contact information**
✓ **Proper packaging**
✓ **Reasonable pricing**

### Red Flags

✗ No lab reports available
✗ Unrealistic health claims
✗ Suspiciously cheap
✗ Unknown company
✗ Missing information

---

## Third-Party Lab Testing

### Why It's Non-Negotiable

Lab reports (COA) verify:
- Actual CBD content
- THC levels
- Absence of contaminants
- Product safety

### What to Look For

**On the lab report:**
- Third-party lab name (not in-house)
- Recent date (within 12 months)
- Batch number matching your product
- Cannabinoid profile (CBD content)
- Contaminant testing results

### How to Find Lab Reports

- QR code on product
- Company website
- Request via email
- If hard to find → red flag

---

## Understanding Labels

### What Should Be On Label

| Information | Why It Matters |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Total CBD (mg)** | Know what you're getting |
| **CBD per serving** | Calculate doses |
| **Ingredients** | Allergens, carrier oils |
| **Batch/lot number** | Matches lab report |
| **Company info** | Accountability |
| **Expiration date** | Freshness |

### Label Math

Example:
- Bottle: 1000mg CBD / 30ml
- Per ml: 33mg CBD
- Per dropper (1ml): 33mg
- Per half dropper: ~16.5mg

Verify this matches lab reports.

## Types of CBD

### Which to Choose

| Type | Contains | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Full-Spectrum** | CBD + cannabinoids + THC (trace) | Maximum potential benefits |
| **Broad-Spectrum** | CBD + cannabinoids, no THC | Drug testing concerns |
| **Isolate** | Pure CBD only | THC zero tolerance |

### Verify the Type

- Full-spectrum should show multiple cannabinoids on COA
- Broad-spectrum should show ND (not detected) for THC
- Isolate should be 99%+ CBD only

---

## Extraction Methods

### Quality Extraction

| Method | Quality | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **CO2 extraction** | Best | Clean, efficient, preserves cannabinoids |
| **Ethanol** | Good | Common, effective |
| **Hydrocarbon** | Variable | Can be good with proper purging |
| **Olive oil** | Basic | Traditional, less efficient |

### What to Look For

- CO2 or ethanol preferred
- Avoid unknown methods
- Residual solvent testing on COA

---

## Hemp Source

### What Matters

**Good indicators:**
- US, EU, or Canadian grown (regulated)
- Organic or organically grown
- Reputable farms
- Traceable sourcing

**Concerns:**
- Unknown origin
- Countries with less regulation
- No sourcing information

### Why Sourcing Matters

Hemp absorbs from soil:
- Heavy metals
- Pesticides
- Contaminants

Quality hemp = cleaner products

## Pricing Reality

### What Quality CBD Costs

| Product | Typical Quality Range |
|---------|----------------------|
| **30ml oil (500-1000mg)** | $30-60 |
| **30ml oil (1500-3000mg)** | $60-120 |
| **Capsules (30ct, 25mg)** | $40-80 |
| **Gummies (30ct, 10-25mg)** | $30-60 |

### Price Red Flags

**Too cheap:**
- May contain less CBD than labeled
- May have contaminants
- May be from poor sources
- If it seems too good to be true...

**Overpriced:**
- Celebrity branding
- Excessive marketing claims
- Doesn't mean better quality

## Brand Evaluation

### How to Assess a Brand

| Factor | What to Check |
|--------|---------------|
| **Reputation** | Reviews, mentions, longevity |
| **Transparency** | Lab reports, sourcing info |
| **Customer service** | Responsive, helpful |
| **Website** | Professional, informative |
| **Claims** | Realistic vs. over-hyped |

### Research Steps

1. Search "[brand name] review"
2. Check independent review sites

4. Contact customer service with questions
5. Trust your overall impression

## What to Avoid

## My Take

Buying quality CBD requires more diligence than buying most supplements because the market is poorly regulated. But it's not complicated once you know what to look for.

The single most important thing: lab reports. If a company won't provide third-party testing, don't buy from them. Period. It takes 5 minutes to check, and it protects you from the many questionable products out there.

Beyond that, buy from companies that are transparent about their sourcing, have reasonable prices (not suspiciously cheap), and don't make outlandish claims. Quality CBD brands want you to have good experiences because they want repeat customers.

If you're new, start with a well-reviewed brand even if it costs a bit more. Once you know what good CBD feels like, you can experiment with other options.
