## My Take

This is one topic where I'm unequivocal: pregnant and nursing women should avoid CBD. The research simply doesn't exist to assure safety, and when it comes to fetal and infant development, the precautionary principle applies.

I understand that pregnancy comes with real challenges—nausea, anxiety, pain, sleep problems. These are legitimate concerns. But other solutions exist that have been studied in pregnancy. CBD hasn't been.

If you're experiencing symptoms that make you consider CBD, talk to your healthcare provider about safe options. They can recommend alternatives that have pregnancy safety data.

Your baby's development is too important to risk on insufficient research.
