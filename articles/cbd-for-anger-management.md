## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD may reduce** reactivity and irritability
2. **Not substitute** for anger management skills
3. **Sleep support** helps indirectly
4. **Professional help** if anger is problematic
5. **Part of approach**, not complete solution

---

## My Take

Anger problems are rarely solved by supplements alone—they require understanding your triggers, building coping skills, and often professional support. CBD can help at the margins by reducing baseline stress and reactivity, creating more space between stimulus and response.

Think of CBD as supporting your ability to pause before reacting, not as eliminating anger. You still need the skills to manage that pause effectively. If anger is significantly impacting your life, professional help will do far more than CBD alone.
