## Key Takeaways

1. **Effects are indirect**—through anxiety/relaxation
2. **Not an aphrodisiac** or libido booster
3. **Individual variation** significant
4. **Research limited** but interest growing
5. **Connection and communication** most important

## My Take

CBD won't transform your sex life, but it may help remove barriers. If anxiety, tension, or physical discomfort interfere with intimacy, CBD's relaxing effects may make a difference. For some people, that reduced anxiety translates to better experiences.

But the foundation of sexual wellness is connection, communication, and addressing real issues—whether relationship dynamics, medical concerns, or psychological factors. CBD can support, not substitute for, these fundamentals.
