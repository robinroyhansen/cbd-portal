## My Take

The pilot study on CBD for smoking cessation was intriguing—a 40% reduction in cigarettes is significant. But we need more research before recommending CBD as a smoking cessation aid.

If you're trying to quit, use proven methods first: nicotine replacement, prescription medications, counseling. CBD might provide additional support for anxiety and cravings, but it shouldn't be your only strategy.
