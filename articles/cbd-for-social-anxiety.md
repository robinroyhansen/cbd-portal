## My Take

Social anxiety is tough because it limits so many opportunities. The research on CBD shows promise—particularly the public speaking studies. While it's not a magic solution, CBD may help take the edge off enough to engage in the social situations you've been avoiding.

Remember, the goal isn't to eliminate all nervousness—some social anxiety is normal. CBD might help reduce it to manageable levels while you work on other coping strategies.
