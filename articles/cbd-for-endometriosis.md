## Key Takeaways

1. **Limited research** on CBD for endometriosis specifically
2. **Anti-inflammatory properties** may help symptoms
3. **ECS involvement** provides theoretical basis
4. **Not a cure**—symptom support only
5. **Work with healthcare provider** on management

## My Take

Endometriosis is challenging to manage, and I understand why many turn to CBD for relief. The anti-inflammatory properties and emerging endocannabinoid research provide theoretical basis. Some women report meaningful symptom improvement.

However, endometriosis requires proper medical management. Use CBD as a potential complement to, not replacement for, treatment recommended by your specialist.
