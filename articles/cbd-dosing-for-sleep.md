## Quick Answer

For sleep, CBD often works best at **higher doses** (50-160mg) than for other uses. Research suggests CBD may be alerting at low doses and sedating at higher doses. Take CBD **30-60 minutes before bed** for optimal timing. Consistency matters—use nightly for at least 2-3 weeks before judging effectiveness.

## The Dose-Dependent Effect

CBD has a biphasic effect on sleep:

| Dose Range | Typical Effect |
|------------|----------------|
| Low (10-25mg) | May be slightly alerting |
| Moderate (25-75mg) | Variable; may help some people |
| Higher (75-160mg) | More consistently sedating |

**Why this matters:** Don't assume your daytime CBD dose will help sleep. You may need to increase it.

## Research-Based Dosing

### Clinical Studies

| Study | Dose | Findings |
|-------|------|----------|
| Anxiety/sleep study | 25mg | Sleep improved in 66% initially |
| Chronic insomnia | 160mg | Increased total sleep time |
| Various studies | 40-160mg | Sleep improvements noted |

### What We Learn
- Lower doses may help sleep indirectly (via anxiety reduction)
- Higher doses appear more directly sedating
- Individual variation is significant

## Starting Protocol for Sleep

### Week 1
- **Start:** 25-50mg
- **Timing:** 1 hour before bed
- **Track:** Sleep onset, wake-ups, morning grogginess
- **Note:** Some improvement or no change expected

### Week 2
- If no improvement: Increase to 50-75mg
- If some improvement: May maintain or slight increase
- Continue tracking

### Week 3-4
- If still no improvement: Increase to 75-100mg
- Some people need 100-150mg for sleep
- Find your minimum effective dose

### Beyond Week 4
- If working: Maintain dose
- If not working after 100mg+: CBD may not be your solution

---

## Timing Is Critical

### Optimal Timing
- **Sublingual:** 30-60 minutes before bed
- **Capsules/Edibles:** 1-2 hours before bed
- **Vaping:** 15-30 minutes before bed (not recommended for sleep due to short duration)

### Too Early
Taking CBD too early (3+ hours before bed) means effects may peak while you're still awake.

### Too Late
Taking CBD at bedtime means peak effects may not align with sleep onset.

## Best Delivery Methods for Sleep

### Sublingual Oil (Recommended)
- Flexible dosing
- Good timing control
- Moderate duration
- Can hold under tongue for better absorption

### Capsules/Softgels
- Consistent dosing
- Longer-lasting (good for staying asleep)
- Slower onset (plan ahead)

### Gummies/Edibles
- Pleasant to take
- Consistent doses
- Slower onset
- Sugar content consideration

### What About CBN?
- [CBN](/knowledge/what-is-cbn) may be more sedating than CBD
- Some sleep products combine CBD + CBN
- Limited research but anecdotally helpful

## Factors Affecting Sleep Response

### Why Sleep Doesn't Come
Understanding your insomnia helps:

| Sleep Problem | CBD May Help? | Notes |
|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Anxiety-driven insomnia | Yes | CBD's anxiolytic effect |
| Pain-related | Possibly | May need pain-focused approach |
| Racing thoughts | Possibly | May help some |
| Sleep apnea | No | Needs medical treatment |
| Hormonal (menopause) | Possibly | Limited evidence |

### Individual Factors
- **Metabolism:** Faster metabolizers may need higher doses
- **Body weight:** Larger individuals often need more
- **Tolerance:** Previous cannabis use may affect response
- **Other substances:** Alcohol, caffeine, medications

---

## Combining with Sleep Hygiene

CBD works best with good sleep practices:

### Sleep Hygiene Basics
- Consistent bedtime/wake time
- Cool, dark bedroom
- No screens 1 hour before bed
- Limit caffeine after noon
- Regular exercise (not too late)

### CBD as Part of Routine
1. Begin wind-down routine
2. Take CBD dose
3. Continue calming activities (reading, etc.)
4. Go to bed as CBD takes effect

---

## What Success Looks Like

**Positive Signs:**
- Falling asleep more easily
- Fewer middle-of-night awakenings
- Feeling more rested in morning
- Less anxiety around bedtime

**CBD is probably not your solution if:**
- No improvement after 4 weeks at adequate doses
- Sleep issues are medical (apnea, restless leg, etc.)
- You need sedation every night

---

## Morning Grogginess

Some people experience grogginess:

### If You Feel Groggy
- Dose may be too high → reduce
- Timing may be off → take earlier
- Product may not suit you → try different type

### Avoiding Grogginess
- Find minimum effective dose
- Ensure 7-8 hours sleep time
- Consider earlier timing

## CBD vs. Sleep Medications

| Factor | CBD | Sleep Medications |
|--------|-----|-------------------|
| Dependence risk | Very low | Varies (some high) |
| Tolerance | Minimal | Often develops |
| Next-day effects | Usually mild | Can be significant |
| Research evidence | Moderate | Extensive |
| Accessibility | OTC | Often prescription |

---

## My Practical Advice

1. **Don't underdose.** Sleep often needs higher doses than daytime anxiety use.

2. **Be patient.** Sleep improvements may take 2-3 weeks to stabilize.

3. **Consider full-spectrum** with terpenes like myrcene and linalool (associated with relaxation).

4. **Address the root cause.** If anxiety keeps you awake, treating anxiety matters more than sedation.

5. **Track your sleep.** Apps or simple journals help identify what's actually working.

6. **CBD isn't a sleeping pill.** It may help create conditions for sleep but won't force unconsciousness.

## When to Seek Professional Help

See a healthcare provider if:
- Sleep problems persist despite interventions
- You suspect sleep apnea (snoring, gasping)
- Insomnia significantly affects daily function
- You're using alcohol or other substances to sleep
- Sleep issues coincide with mood problems
