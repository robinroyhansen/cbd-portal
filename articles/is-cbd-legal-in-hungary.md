## My Take

Hungary offers a developing CBD market that's more accessible than Nordic countries but less open than Germany or the UK. Budapest has reasonable options, and online ordering works nationwide.

The market is more conservative than Western Europe—you won't find CBD cafes or as prominent retail presence—but products are available for those who seek them.

Quality-wise, stick to established brands with proper testing, whether Hungarian or from quality EU suppliers.
