## Key Takeaways

1. **Limited evidence** for eye health claims
2. **May worsen** glaucoma
3. **Not recommended** over standard eye care
4. **Eye-specific products** need caution
5. **See eye doctor** for eye concerns

## My Take

Eye health claims for CBD are mostly marketing without evidence. More concerning, CBD may actually worsen some eye conditions like glaucoma by increasing eye pressure.

For eye health, stick with proven approaches: regular eye exams, proper lighting, screen breaks, and appropriate treatments prescribed by your eye doctor. CBD isn't the answer for eye-specific concerns.
