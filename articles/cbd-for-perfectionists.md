## Key Takeaways

1. **Reduces anxiety** that fuels perfectionism
2. **Doesn't lower** your standards
3. **Don't seek** perfect product or protocol
4. **Consistent use** matters most
5. **Consider therapy** for underlying patterns

---

## My Take

Perfectionism is tricky because it drives both achievement and suffering. CBD can help with the suffering part—the anxiety, the harsh self-judgment, the chronic stress—without eliminating the high standards that also bring accomplishment.

The irony is that perfectionists often struggle to start CBD because they want to find the "perfect" product and "perfect" protocol. Just start. A good product used consistently is infinitely better than the perfect product you never buy.
