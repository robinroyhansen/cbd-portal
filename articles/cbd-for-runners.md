## Key Takeaways

1. **Recovery is main application** for runners
2. **Anti-inflammatory** without NSAID concerns
3. **Sleep support** aids training adaptation
4. **THC-free** if racing at tested events
5. **Don't try new** things on race day

## My Take

CBD fits naturally into a runner's recovery toolkit. The anti-inflammatory benefits support recovery without the healing impairment concerns of daily NSAID use. And the sleep benefits are crucial—that's when adaptation happens.

For most recreational runners, full-spectrum CBD is fine. If you're competing at a level with drug testing, stick to THC-free options verified by third-party testing.
