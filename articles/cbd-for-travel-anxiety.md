## My Take

Travel anxiety is genuinely difficult, and CBD can be a helpful tool for managing it. I've heard from countless travelers who find that CBD takes the edge off without the drowsiness of antihistamines or the impairment risks of stronger medications.

The biggest considerations are legal. Research your destination thoroughly. Don't bring CBD to countries where it's prohibited—the consequences can be severe. Within legal jurisdictions, pack properly with original packaging and lab reports.

For flying specifically, CBD works well. For driving, be very careful—only use if you're certain it doesn't affect your driving ability, and never use for the first time before getting behind the wheel.
