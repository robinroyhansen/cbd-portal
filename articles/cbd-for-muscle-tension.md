## My Take

Muscle tension is one of the applications where CBD seems genuinely helpful. The combination of potential muscle-relaxing effects and anxiety reduction addresses tension from multiple angles.

For best results, combine topical CBD on affected areas with stretching and stress management. If you're dealing with chronic tension from desk work, addressing the root cause (posture, breaks, stress) matters as much as symptom relief.
