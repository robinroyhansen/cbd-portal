## Key Takeaways

2. **Some concern** about potential worsening
3. **May help** with anxiety/stress from tinnitus
4. **Seek medical evaluation** for tinnitus
5. **Evidence-based therapies** exist

## My Take

This is one case where I can't recommend CBD for the primary symptom. The research doesn't support it, and there's even some concern CBD could worsen tinnitus. If you're dealing with tinnitus, see an audiologist or ENT for proper evaluation and evidence-based treatment.

That said, if tinnitus is causing you significant anxiety or sleep problems, CBD might help with those secondary issues. Just understand you're treating the stress, not the ringing.
