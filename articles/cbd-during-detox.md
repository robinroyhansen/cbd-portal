## My Take

CBD shows genuine promise as a supportive tool during recovery. The anxiety reduction and sleep support are particularly relevant during what's often an incredibly difficult time.

However, CBD is not a treatment for addiction. It may help with some symptoms, but recovery requires comprehensive support—medical, therapeutic, and social. Always work with professionals during detox.
