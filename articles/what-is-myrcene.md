## Quick Answer

Myrcene is the most abundant [terpene](/knowledge/what-are-terpenes) in cannabis, often comprising 20-50% of a strain's terpene profile. It has an earthy, musky, herbal aroma with clove-like notes. Research suggests myrcene may have sedating, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties. It's also found in mangoes, hops, lemongrass, and thyme.

## Potential Effects and Benefits

Research suggests myrcene may provide:

**Sedation and Relaxation**
- May enhance sedating effects of cannabinoids
- Contributes to the "couch-lock" effect in some strains
- Traditionally used for sleep support

**Anti-inflammatory**
- Studies show anti-inflammatory activity in animal models
- May work synergistically with CBD

**Analgesic (Pain Relief)**
- Demonstrated pain-reducing effects in research
- May enhance analgesic properties of cannabinoids

**Muscle Relaxant**
- Traditional use as a muscle relaxant
- May contribute to physical relaxation effects

## The Mango Myth

You may have heard eating mangoes before cannabis intensifies effects. The theory: mangoes contain myrcene, which helps cannabinoids cross the blood-brain barrier faster.

**Reality:** While mangoes do contain myrcene, the amount is small. Scientific evidence for this effect is lacking. It may have a mild influence, but expectations often exceed reality.

## Myrcene in CBD Products

Products high in myrcene may be labeled as:
- "Relaxing" or "calming"
- Good for evening use
- Indica-type profiles
- Sleep support formulas

Full-spectrum CBD products naturally contain varying amounts of myrcene depending on the source hemp strain.

## The Entourage Effect

Myrcene is often cited in discussions of the [entourage effect](/knowledge/entourage-effect)—the theory that cannabinoids and terpenes work better together than alone. Myrcene may:

- Increase cell membrane permeability
- Enhance cannabinoid absorption
- Contribute to overall effects beyond just aroma

---

## Research Status

Myrcene research includes:
- Animal studies on sedation and analgesia
- In-vitro anti-inflammatory research
- Traditional medicine documentation
- Limited human clinical trials

More human research is needed to confirm effects observed in laboratory settings.

## My Take

Myrcene is the workhorse terpene of cannabis. If you've ever noticed some CBD products feel more relaxing than others, myrcene content may be part of the reason. I find terpene-rich, full-spectrum products generally more effective than isolates, and myrcene-dominant profiles particularly useful for evening relaxation.
