## Quick Summary

CBD distillate is a highly refined cannabis extract, typically containing 80-95% CBD. It's created through distillation—a purification process that removes plant materials, waxes, and other compounds, leaving an extremely pure, viscous oil. CBD distillate is versatile, used in vape products, edibles, topicals, and as a base for other CBD products.

## What Is CBD Distillate?

### Definition

CBD distillate is a purified form of CBD extract that has undergone distillation to remove impurities, leaving behind a thick, golden oil with very high CBD concentration.

### Characteristics

**Appearance:**
- Golden to amber colour
- Clear, translucent
- Thick, viscous consistency
- Honey-like texture

**Purity:**
- 80-95%+ CBD typically
- Minimal plant matter
- Clean, refined product
- High cannabinoid concentration

## How CBD Distillate Is Made

### The Process

**1. Initial Extraction:**
- CBD extracted from hemp
- CO2, ethanol, or hydrocarbon methods
- Creates crude extract

**2. Winterisation:**
- Extract mixed with ethanol
- Frozen to separate waxes/fats
- Filtered to remove solids

**3. Decarboxylation:**
- Heat applied to activate CBD
- Converts CBDA to CBD

**4. Distillation:**
- Short-path or wiped-film distillation
- Uses heat and vacuum
- Separates compounds by boiling point
- CBD collected as distillate

### Why Distillation?

- Removes impurities
- Concentrates CBD
- Can isolate specific compounds
- Creates consistent product

## CBD Distillate vs. Other Forms

### Comparison

| Factor | Distillate | Crude | Isolate |
|--------|------------|-------|---------|
| Purity | 80-95% | 50-70% | 99%+ |
| Processing | High | Minimal | Highest |
| Other cannabinoids | Some | Many | None |
| Terpenes | Some/few | More | None |
| Colour | Golden | Dark | White |

### Why Choose Distillate?

- Balance of purity and profile
- Versatile applications
- Consistent quality
- Good for manufacturing

## Quality Considerations

### What to Look For

**Quality Indicators:**
- Clear, golden colour
- Smooth consistency
- Third-party tested
- Potency verified
- Residual solvent testing

### Testing Requirements

**Essential:**
- Cannabinoid profile (CBD %, THC %)
- Residual solvents
- Pesticides
- Heavy metals
- Microbial

### Red Flags

**Avoid If:**
- Dark or cloudy appearance
- No testing available
- Unknown source
- Unusual smell
- Inconsistent texture

---

## Potency and Dosing

### High Concentration

**Typical Potency:**
- 80-95% CBD
- Very concentrated
- Small amounts effective
- Precise measuring needed

### Dosing

**When Using Directly:**
- Start very small
- Calculate: amount × %CBD
- Example: 100mg at 90% = 90mg CBD
- Most people need far less per dose

### As Product Base

**For Formulation:**
- Dilute with carrier oil
- Calculate final concentration
- Ensure accurate labelling
- Test finished product

## Is CBD Distillate Right for You?

### Good Choice If

- Making your own products
- Want highly concentrated CBD
- Have specific formulation needs
- Experienced with concentrates
- Need versatile base

### Better Alternatives If

- New to CBD (try finished products)
- Want convenience (oils, gummies)
- Need full plant profile (crude or full-spectrum oil)
- Don't want to handle concentrates

## My Take

CBD distillate is the workhorse of the CBD industry—it's what many finished products are made from. For consumers, it's typically more practical to buy finished products rather than pure distillate, unless you're making your own formulations. The exception is experienced users who want a concentrated, versatile product for dabbing or custom creations. Quality distillate should be clear, golden, properly tested, and from a reputable source.
