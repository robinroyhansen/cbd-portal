## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD complements** cold plunge benefits
2. **Before: reduces** anxiety, supports stress response
3. **After: extends** anti-inflammatory effects
4. **Safety first**—cold shock is real
5. **Build up** gradually over time

## My Take

Cold plunge is challenging—that's part of its value. CBD can support the process by helping manage the stress response without eliminating the beneficial challenge. It's not about making cold plunge easy; it's about making the adaptation more effective.

Start slowly with cold exposure, and let CBD support your practice rather than trying to eliminate the discomfort entirely. The mental resilience built through embracing the cold is part of the benefit.
