## Key Takeaways

2. **Thailand is uniquely liberal** in Asia

5. **Regulations evolving** — stay informed
6. **Unique opportunity** for CBD access in region

## My Take

Thailand's cannabis liberalization is remarkable for Asia. Where neighboring countries have strict prohibition, Thailand has embraced cannabis and CBD for wellness, recreation, and economic development.

For visitors, this means easy access to CBD (and cannabis) products throughout the country. Quality varies, so use some judgment—but availability is not a problem.

The critical point: Thailand's liberalization is domestic. Do NOT attempt to take any products out of Thailand. Your destination country almost certainly prohibits import, and the consequences can be severe.

Enjoy Thailand's CBD market while you're there, but leave it behind when you go.
