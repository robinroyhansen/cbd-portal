## The Short Answer

Does CBD help pets? Based on the 16 studies I have reviewed, there is moderate evidence that CBD can help dogs with certain conditions, particularly osteoarthritis and epilepsy. Research in cats and other pets is more limited. Dogs have [endocannabinoid systems](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) similar to humans, and several veterinary clinical trials show promising results. However, THC is toxic to pets, so only THC-free CBD products should be used.

## What the Research Shows

### Dogs

Several well-designed studies in dogs show CBD can:
- Reduce arthritis pain and improve mobility
- Decrease seizure frequency in epileptic dogs
- May help with anxiety

A landmark study found that 2mg/kg CBD twice daily significantly improved comfort and activity levels in dogs with osteoarthritis, with over 80% showing measurable improvement.

### Cats

Research in cats is more limited. Cats metabolize cannabinoids differently than dogs, and their sensitivity to THC makes dosing more challenging. Some early studies suggest potential benefits, but more research is needed.

### Other Pets

Research on CBD for horses, birds, and other animals is minimal. The [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) exists across mammals, but species-specific research is lacking.

## Safety Considerations

- **THC toxicity:** THC is toxic to pets. Only use THC-free CBD products.
- **Dosing:** Pets require different doses than humans. Follow veterinary guidance.
- **Quality:** Choose pet-specific products tested for safety and purity.
- **Drug interactions:** CBD may interact with pet medications. Consult your vet.

## My Take

The veterinary CBD research is genuinely encouraging, particularly for dogs with arthritis or epilepsy. If your dog suffers from these conditions, discussing CBD with your veterinarian is reasonable. The evidence base, while still growing, is stronger than for many conditions in humans.

I'm more cautious about cats due to limited research and their different metabolism. And I would not recommend giving CBD to pets without veterinary guidance.
