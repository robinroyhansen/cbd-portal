## Quick Summary

The cheapest way to take CBD is high-strength oil bought in larger bottles, purchased directly from brands with subscription discounts. Per-mg cost is the key metric—not bottle price. Avoid gummies and convenience formats if budget is the priority.

---

## Key Takeaways

- High-strength oil is most economical
- Calculate cost per mg, not bottle price
- Larger bottles = better value
- Subscribe for discounts
- Gummies/capsules cost more

## Cost Per mg: The Key Metric

### How to Calculate

**Formula:** Price ÷ Total mg = Cost per mg

**Example:**
- 1000mg bottle at £60 = £0.06/mg
- 250mg bottle at £30 = £0.12/mg

The larger bottle is 50% cheaper per mg.

## Product Cost Comparison

### By Format

| Format | Typical Cost per mg |
|--------|-------------------|
| High-strength oil | £0.04-0.08 |
| Standard oil | £0.08-0.12 |
| Capsules | £0.10-0.15 |
| Gummies | £0.12-0.20 |
| Topicals | Variable |
| Vapes | £0.10-0.15 |

### Clear Winner

CBD oil—especially high concentration—offers best value.

## Strategies to Save Money

### 1. Buy Higher Strength

**Why It Works:**
- Price doesn't scale with mg
- 2000mg often only 1.5x price of 1000mg
- Fewer bottles to buy
- Same amount of CBD, less cost

### 2. Buy Larger Bottles

- 30ml cheaper per ml than 10ml
- Bulk sizes available
- Less packaging cost passed on
- Stock up if you know your dose

### 3. Subscribe and Save

**Most Brands Offer:**
- 10-20% subscription discount
- Free shipping often
- Convenient auto-delivery
- Easy to cancel

### 4. Buy Direct

- Skip retail markup
- Often better prices
- More selection
- Direct from brand

### 5. Find Minimum Effective Dose

- Don't overspend on excess
- Find what actually works
- Use only what you need
- Optimise before buying more

## What to Avoid for Value

### Expensive Formats

**Cost More for Same CBD:**
- Gummies (convenience tax)
- Capsules (processing cost)
- Small bottles (packaging cost)
- Specialty products

### Premium Brands Sometimes

- Paying for marketing
- Fancy packaging
- Celebrity endorsements
- Not always better quality

---

## Budget-Friendly Approach

### Smart Shopping Steps

1. **Calculate your monthly dose** — mg per day × 30
2. **Find high-strength options** — 1500mg+ bottles
3. **Compare per-mg costs** — Across brands
4. **Look for subscriptions** — Extra 15-20% off
5. **Buy sufficient quantity** — Avoid small bottles

### Example Calculation

**Need:** 30mg/day = 900mg/month

**Option A:** 1000mg at £60 = £0.06/mg = £54/month
**Option B:** 250mg at £30 (need 4) = £0.12/mg = £108/month

Option A saves £54/month.

## Quality Warnings

### Don't Sacrifice

**Always Ensure:**
- Third-party tested
- Reputable brand
- Known company
- COAs available

**Cheapest Isn't Best If:**
- No testing
- Unknown source
- Too good to be true
- Questionable quality

### Balance

- Find value, not cheapest
- Quality matters
- Pay for testing
- Reasonable savings possible

---

## Isolate vs Full-Spectrum for Cost

### Consider Isolate

**Often Cheaper:**
- Simpler to produce
- Less processing
- May work for some

**But:**
- May be less effective
- Missing entourage effect
- Try both, see what works

---

## My Take

The cheapest approach is high-strength CBD oil (1500mg+), bought in larger bottles, with subscription discounts, directly from reputable brands. Calculate cost per mg, not bottle price. But don't sacrifice quality for savings—untested, cheap CBD is a waste of money if it doesn't work or isn't safe.
