## My Take

Architecture combines creative demands with technical precision and project pressures—it's mentally demanding work that often extends beyond reasonable hours. CBD can help manage this load: light doses during work hours to ease stress without compromising precision, higher doses after work to genuinely disconnect and recover. The key for architects is protecting the technical accuracy your work requires while still getting stress relief benefits.
