# CBD Pharmacokinetics: How Your Body Processes CBD

## Quick Summary

Pharmacokinetics describes how CBD moves through your body—absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination. CBD has low oral bioavailability (6-19%), is highly lipophilic, gets metabolized by liver enzymes (primarily CYP3A4 and CYP2C19), and has a half-life of 18-32 hours. Understanding pharmacokinetics helps explain why delivery method, timing, and food intake all affect CBD's effects.

## The Four Phases

### 1. Absorption
How CBD enters your bloodstream:

| Method | Bioavailability | Onset |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Inhalation (vape) | 31-34% | Minutes |
| Sublingual | 13-35% | 15-45 min |
| Oral (swallowed) | 6-19% | 1-2 hours |
| Topical | Local only | Minutes |

**Key factor:** CBD is lipophilic (fat-loving), so taking it with fatty foods dramatically increases absorption—up to 4-5 times higher bioavailability.

### 2. Distribution
Where CBD goes in your body:

- Highly fat-soluble, so it accumulates in fatty tissues
- Crosses the blood-brain barrier
- Distributes throughout organs and tissues
- Can remain stored in fat for extended periods
- Volume of distribution is high (~32 L/kg)

### 3. Metabolism
How CBD is broken down:

**Primary pathway:** Liver metabolism via cytochrome P450 enzymes
- **CYP3A4** - Major enzyme for CBD metabolism
- **CYP2C19** - Secondary pathway
- **CYP2C9** - Minor contribution

**Metabolites:**
- 7-OH-CBD (7-hydroxy-CBD) - primary metabolite
- 7-COOH-CBD (7-carboxy-CBD)
- Various hydroxylated and carboxylated derivatives

**First-pass effect:** When swallowed, CBD passes through the liver before reaching circulation, significantly reducing available CBD.

### 4. Elimination
How CBD leaves your body:

- **Half-life:** 18-32 hours (can vary widely)
- **Primary route:** Feces (via bile)
- **Secondary route:** Urine
- **Steady state:** Reached after ~1 week of daily use
- **Complete elimination:** May take several weeks after stopping

## Why Bioavailability Matters

Low bioavailability means most CBD you take doesn't reach your bloodstream:

**Example with 30mg oral dose:**
- At 10% bioavailability: Only 3mg reaches circulation
- At 6% bioavailability: Only 1.8mg reaches circulation

This explains why:
- Oral doses need to be higher than sublingual
- Food significantly affects results
- Some people need much higher doses than others
- Delivery method matters as much as total mg

## First-Pass Metabolism

When you swallow CBD:

1. CBD enters stomach and intestines
2. Absorbed into portal vein
3. Goes directly to liver
4. Liver metabolizes significant portion
5. Remaining CBD enters systemic circulation

**Sublingual delivery** partially bypasses this by absorbing through mouth mucosa directly into bloodstream.

## Food and Absorption

Taking CBD with food, especially fatty food:

| Factor | Without Food | With High-Fat Meal |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Bioavailability | ~6% | ~24% |
| Peak levels | Lower | 4-5x higher |
| Time to peak | 1-2 hours | 2-4 hours |

**Practical advice:** Take CBD with a meal containing some fat (avocado, nuts, olive oil, cheese, etc.) for better absorption.

---

## Time Course of Effects

**Single dose:**
- Onset: 30min - 2 hours (oral)
- Peak levels: 1-4 hours
- Duration: 4-12 hours (varies)

**Daily dosing:**
- Steady state: ~1 week
- Accumulation in fatty tissues
- More consistent effects over time
- May need lower doses once stable

---

## Individual Variation

Many factors affect your CBD pharmacokinetics:

**Genetic:**
- CYP enzyme variants
- Cannabinoid receptor polymorphisms
- Body composition

**Physiological:**
- Age
- Weight
- Body fat percentage
- Liver function
- Recent food intake

**Other:**
- Concurrent medications
- Other supplements
- Regular vs occasional use

---

## Drug Interactions

CBD inhibits CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 enzymes, potentially affecting medications:

- Certain seizure medications
- Blood thinners (warfarin)
- Some statins
- Certain immunosuppressants
- Various psychiatric medications

**Important:** Consult healthcare providers about potential interactions with any medications.

## Half-Life Implications

CBD's 18-32 hour half-life means:

- Once daily dosing is often sufficient
- Takes ~1 week to reach steady state
- Stays in system for weeks after stopping
- May accumulate with frequent use
- Effects may build over time

---

## Research Limitations

Current pharmacokinetic knowledge has gaps:

- Most studies use pure CBD, not full-spectrum products
- Terpene/cannabinoid interactions may affect kinetics
- Long-term accumulation effects not fully understood
- Individual variation not well characterized
- Optimal dosing strategies still unclear

---

## Practical Takeaways

1. **Take with fatty food** for best absorption
2. **Be patient** - effects may build over days/weeks
3. **Consistency matters** - regular dosing establishes steady levels
4. **Timing flexibility** - long half-life allows flexible dosing
5. **Start low** - due to accumulation, start conservative

---

## My Take

Understanding pharmacokinetics transformed how I think about CBD dosing. The low bioavailability of oral CBD explains why people often need higher doses than they expect. The importance of fat in absorption explains why taking CBD on an empty stomach often disappoints. And the long half-life explains why consistent daily use tends to work better than occasional use.

This isn't just academic knowledge—it's practical information that can make the difference between CBD working for you or concluding it doesn't work at all.
