## Quick Summary

Pharmacokinetics describes how CBD is absorbed, distributed, metabolised, and eliminated by the body. CBD is fat-soluble with low oral bioavailability, metabolised primarily by liver enzymes, and has a half-life of 18-32 hours with regular use.

## Key Takeaways

- CBD is highly fat-soluble, affecting absorption and distribution
- First-pass metabolism significantly reduces oral bioavailability
- Metabolised by CYP450 enzymes (drug interaction relevance)
- Half-life: 18-32 hours with regular use
- Accumulates in fatty tissue over time

## ADME: The Four Stages

### Absorption

How CBD enters the bloodstream:
- **Oral:** 6-19% bioavailability, slow onset
- **Sublingual:** 20-35% bioavailability, faster onset
- **Inhaled:** 30-40% bioavailability, immediate onset
- **Topical:** Minimal systemic absorption

Factors affecting absorption:
- Food (especially fats) increases absorption
- Formulation (nano, liposomal) may improve uptake
- Individual gut health matters

### Distribution

Where CBD goes in the body:
- Highly lipophilic (fat-loving)
- Accumulates in adipose tissue
- Distributes widely throughout body
- Crosses blood-brain barrier
- Volume of distribution: very large (32 L/kg)

### Metabolism

How CBD is processed:
- Primary: Liver (CYP3A4, CYP2C19)
- Secondary: Gut metabolism
- Creates multiple metabolites
- 7-OH-CBD (active metabolite)
- First-pass effect significant for oral use

### Elimination

How CBD leaves the body:
- Primarily through faeces
- Some urinary excretion
- Half-life increases with chronic use
- Complete elimination: 5-7 days after stopping

## Clinical Implications

### Drug Interactions

CBD's enzyme effects:
- Inhibits CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19
- May increase levels of other medications
- Similar concern to grapefruit
- Consult healthcare providers

### Dosing Implications

Understanding pharmacokinetics helps with:
- Why consistent dosing works better
- Why effects build over time
- Why food matters for absorption
- Why different methods feel different

---

## My Take

Understanding pharmacokinetics demystifies CBD dosing. The half-life data explains why consistent use works better than sporadic dosing—CBD accumulates over time. The metabolism information is crucial for anyone on medications. This isn't just academic; it's practical knowledge for better CBD use.
