## Quick Comparison

| Factor | CBD | CBN |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Full Name** | Cannabidiol | Cannabinol |
| **Origin** | Hemp plant (direct) | THC degradation |
| **Research Level** | Extensive | Very limited |
| **Primary Use** | Versatile (anxiety, pain, sleep) | Sleep (marketing claim) |
| **Sedating** | Mildly (dose-dependent) | Possibly (debated) |
| **Cost** | Moderate | Higher |

## What Is CBN?

### The Degradation Cannabinoid

CBN is unique:
- Formed when THC degrades (age, heat, light)
- Not produced directly by the plant
- Found in aged cannabis
- Associated with "sleepy old weed"
- Small amounts in fresh hemp

### Marketing vs. Reality

CBN is heavily marketed for sleep, but:
- Research is extremely limited
- "Sleepy old weed" may be terpene-related
- Claims often outpace evidence
- Mechanism not well-understood

---

## How They Work

### CBD's Mechanism

Well-studied:
- Modulates endocannabinoid system
- Serotonin receptor interaction
- GABA system effects
- Multiple pathways understood

### CBN's Mechanism

Less understood:
- Weak CB1 receptor binding
- Possible CB2 activity
- May enhance effects of other cannabinoids
- Mechanism for sleep unclear

**Important:** The sleep claim for CBN lacks strong scientific support.

---

## Research Reality

### CBD Research

Extensive:
- Thousands of studies
- FDA-approved drug
- Human clinical trials
- Established evidence for anxiety, epilepsy
- Growing evidence for sleep

### CBN Research

Very limited:
- Minimal human studies
- One dated human study (1975, small, also with THC)
- Mostly preclinical
- Marketing far ahead of science
- No clinical trials for sleep

**Honest assessment:** CBN sleep claims are largely based on anecdote and marketing, not robust research.

## For Sleep

### CBD for Sleep

What evidence supports:
- May help through anxiety reduction
- Some sleep improvement in studies
- Not directly sedating (for most)
- Higher doses more sleep-supportive
- Addresses causes of poor sleep

### CBN for Sleep

What we actually know:
- Marketed heavily as sleep aid
- Limited scientific backing
- May work through placebo effect
- May work through other mechanisms
- Anecdotal reports vary
- Often combined with CBD, melatonin (confounds effect)

**Reality:** If CBN works for your sleep, it may be due to combination products, placebo, or mechanisms we don't understand—not proven sedative properties.

## Other Potential Uses

### CBD Uses (Evidence-Based)

| Use | Evidence |
|-----|----------|
| Anxiety | Strong |
| Epilepsy | FDA-approved |
| Pain | Moderate |
| Inflammation | Moderate |
| Sleep | Moderate |

### CBN Uses (Preliminary)

| Use | Evidence |
|-----|----------|
| Antibacterial | Preclinical |
| Anti-inflammatory | Preclinical |
| Appetite stimulation | Very preliminary |
| Neuroprotection | Very preliminary |

---

## Side Effects

### CBD Side Effects

Known and mild:
- Dry mouth
- Drowsiness (dose-dependent)
- Potential drug interactions
- Mild GI effects sometimes

### CBN Side Effects

Not well-characterized:
- Likely similar to CBD
- May cause drowsiness
- Less data available
- Caution warranted

---

## Cost Comparison

### Why CBN Costs More

- Low natural abundance
- Must age cannabis or use specific processes
- Smaller market
- Less economy of scale

**Typical prices:**
- CBD oil: $0.05-0.10/mg
- CBN oil: $0.15-0.30/mg

CBN often costs 2-3x more than CBD.

## Product Reality

### How CBN Is Marketed

- "The sleep cannabinoid"
- Often in "sleep formulas"
- Combined with CBD, melatonin, herbs
- Premium pricing

### What to Watch For

When evaluating CBN products:
- Is CBN the only ingredient, or combined?
- Combined products confound which ingredient helps
- Melatonin may be doing the work
- CBD may be doing the work
- Marketing vs. evidence gap is large

---

## Which to Choose?

### Choose CBD If:

- You want evidence-backed support
- Anxiety contributes to sleep issues
- Cost matters
- You prefer established safety profile
- Sleep isn't only concern (versatility)

### Consider CBN If:

- CBD alone hasn't helped sleep
- You want to experiment
- Willing to pay premium
- Understand evidence limitations
- Open to trying combination products

### Practical Suggestion

If interested in CBN for sleep:
1. Try CBD for sleep first (better evidence, lower cost)
2. If insufficient, try CBD + melatonin
3. If still insufficient, try CBN-containing product
4. Recognize you're in experimental territory

## CBN Products to Consider

### If You Try CBN

- Look for CBD:CBN combination products
- Check for third-party testing
- Start with low doses
- Track your response
- Don't expect miracles

### Quality Markers

- Third-party tested
- Clear CBN content listed
- Reputable brand
- Realistic claims

## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD has far more research** than CBN
2. **CBN sleep claims lack strong evidence** — marketing exceeds science
3. **CBN costs significantly more** than CBD
4. **Try CBD first** for sleep—better evidence, lower cost
5. **CBN products often combined** — confounds what's working
6. **Be skeptical** of dramatic CBN claims

---

## My Take

I'll be direct: CBN is heavily overhyped for sleep. The marketing has far outpaced the science, and many people are paying premium prices for something with minimal evidence.

The "sleepy old weed" phenomenon that started the CBN-sleep association is more likely due to terpene profiles in aged cannabis than CBN itself. The one human study frequently cited is from 1975, small, and included THC.

If you want to try something for sleep, start with CBD—it has actual research and costs less. If CBD isn't enough, add melatonin (also researched). Only after exhausting better options would I suggest trying CBN, and then with realistic expectations.

CBN might work for you—but if it does, we don't really know why. And that's fine to experiment with, as long as you're not paying premium prices expecting a miracle "sleep cannabinoid" based on marketing claims.
