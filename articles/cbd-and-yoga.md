## Key Takeaways

2. **Low doses work best** — avoid sedation

4. **Topicals for physical support** before/after
5. **Not required** — enhancement, not necessity
6. **Respect your practice** — use mindfully

## My Take

CBD and yoga make a natural pairing for many practitioners. Both promote relaxation and present-moment awareness, and combining them can create a deeper, more restorative experience.

The key is keeping CBD doses low—you want subtle calm, not drowsiness. Yoga requires attention and body awareness, which high CBD doses might diminish. Start lower than your usual dose and see how it affects your practice.

I'd recommend trying CBD with slower, more restorative styles first. Once you know how it affects you, experiment with more active practices. And remember—yoga is effective on its own. CBD is an optional enhancement, not a requirement for a good practice.
