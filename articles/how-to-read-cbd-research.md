## Quick Summary

Reading CBD research effectively requires understanding study design, evaluating methodology quality, interpreting results correctly, and placing findings in context. This guide provides practical tools for assessing CBD studies and avoiding common misinterpretations.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Study type determines evidence strength
- Abstract alone can mislead
- Methods section reveals quality
- Statistical vs clinical significance differ
- Context and replication matter

---

## Where to Find Research

### Reliable Sources

**Primary:**
- PubMed (pubmed.gov)
- Google Scholar
- ClinicalTrials.gov
- Cochrane Library

**What to Avoid:**
- Company websites alone
- News articles only
- Social media claims
- Marketing materials

---

## Anatomy of a Research Paper

### Key Sections

**Abstract:**
- Summary of entire study
- Often what people read
- Can be misleading alone
- Start here, don't stop here

**Introduction:**
- Background and rationale
- Research question
- What's already known
- Why study was done

**Methods:**
- How study was conducted
- Critical for quality assessment
- Details that matter
- Read carefully

**Results:**
- What was found
- Data and statistics
- Tables and figures
- Raw findings

**Discussion:**
- What results mean
- Limitations acknowledged
- Context provided
- Authors' interpretation

---

## Evaluating Study Design

### Questions to Ask

**What Type of Study?**
- Systematic review (strongest)
- RCT (gold standard for interventions)
- Observational (correlations)
- Animal (preclinical)
- In vitro (laboratory)

**Was There a Control Group?**
- Placebo control ideal
- Active control acceptable
- No control = weaker evidence

**Was It Blinded?**
- Double-blind best
- Single-blind acceptable
- Open-label = potential bias

---

## Assessing Methodology

### Sample Size

**Look For:**
- Number of participants
- Power calculation mentioned
- Adequate for conclusions
- Small = less reliable

**Red Flags:**
- Very small studies (<30)
- No power calculation
- High dropout rates

### Duration

**Consider:**
- How long was the study?
- Adequate for outcome?
- Long-term effects assessed?
- Follow-up included?

### Outcome Measures

**Evaluate:**
- Are outcomes relevant?
- Objective or subjective?
- Validated measures used?
- Primary vs secondary outcomes

---

## Understanding Results

### Statistical Terms

**P-Value:**
- Probability of chance result
- p<0.05 = statistically significant
- Lower ≠ more important
- Can be misleading

**Effect Size:**
- How big was the difference?
- More important than p-value
- Clinical relevance indicator
- Look for this

**Confidence Interval:**
- Range of likely true values
- Wider = less certain
- Crossing zero = no effect
- More informative than p-value

---

## Statistical vs Clinical Significance

### Key Difference

**Statistically Significant:**
- Unlikely due to chance
- Mathematical concept
- Can be trivial effect

**Clinically Significant:**
- Meaningful in real life
- Would patients notice?
- Worth the costs/risks?
- What actually matters

### Example

"CBD reduced anxiety scores by 2 points (p<0.001)"
- Statistically significant? Yes
- Clinically meaningful? Depends on the scale
- If scale is 0-100, probably not

---

## Red Flags

### In Study Design

- No control group
- Not blinded
- Very small sample
- Short duration
- High dropout
- Post-hoc changes

### In Results

- Cherry-picking outcomes
- Selective reporting
- Spin in interpretation
- Ignoring limitations
- Overstating findings

### In Context

- Single study cited as proof
- Animal studies applied to humans
- Ignoring conflicting evidence
- Industry funding not disclosed

---

## Evaluating CBD Claims

### Trace the Evidence

**When You See a Claim:**

1. What's the source?
2. Is there a study cited?
3. What type of study?
4. Human or animal?
5. How many participants?
6. Was it controlled?
7. Are there replications?

### Common Misrepresentations

**"Studies Show..."**
- Which studies?
- What kind?
- How many?
- How strong?

**"Clinically Proven..."**
- By what trials?
- Approved for what?
- By which regulator?
- Often misleading

## Putting Studies in Context

### Single Study Limitations

- May not replicate
- Could be outlier
- Needs confirmation
- Part of bigger picture

### Look For

- Multiple studies agreeing
- Systematic reviews
- Consistent findings
- Different research groups

---

## Practical Application

### Quick Assessment Checklist

- [ ] Human study? (ideal)
- [ ] Adequate sample size? (>50 preferred)
- [ ] Placebo-controlled?
- [ ] Double-blinded?
- [ ] Peer-reviewed journal?
- [ ] Results replicated elsewhere?
- [ ] Funding disclosed?
- [ ] Limitations acknowledged?

### When to Be Sceptical

- Revolutionary claims
- Single study "proves"
- Animal study = human cure
- In vitro applied broadly
- No limitations mentioned
- Industry-only funded

---

## Resources for Learning More

### Tools

- Cochrane Library (reviews)
- CONSORT (trial reporting standards)
- GRADE (evidence quality)
- Science Media Centre

### Skills to Develop

- Basic statistics understanding
- Critical thinking
- Evidence hierarchy familiarity
- Bias recognition

---

## My Take

Reading research critically is a skill that protects you from misinformation. You don't need a science degree—just healthy scepticism and a framework for evaluation. When evaluating CBD claims, always ask: what's the actual evidence, not what does marketing say? A few minutes of investigation often reveals whether claims are supported by strong evidence or are stretching preliminary findings.
