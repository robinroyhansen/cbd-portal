## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD may help** dental anxiety
2. **Take before** appointments (45-60 min)
3. **Tell your dentist** about CBD use
4. **Test beforehand** if possible
5. **May need more** for severe phobia

## My Take

Dental anxiety is frustrating because you know you need care but anxiety makes it feel impossible. CBD's anxiety-reducing effects can help lower the barrier to getting in that dentist's chair.

Don't expect CBD to eliminate all nervousness—some is normal. But if it helps you go from avoiding appointments to actually attending, that's a significant benefit for your dental and overall health.
