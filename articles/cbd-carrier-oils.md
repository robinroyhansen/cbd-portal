## Quick Summary

Carrier oils dilute concentrated CBD extract into a usable product and improve absorption. Common carriers include MCT oil (coconut-derived), hemp seed oil, olive oil, and sunflower oil. Each has different absorption rates, tastes, and benefits. The carrier oil can affect how quickly CBD works and how well your body absorbs it.

## Key Takeaways

- Carrier oils enable CBD absorption
- MCT oil is most common
- Different carriers have different benefits
- Affects taste and texture
- Impacts bioavailability

---

## Why CBD Needs Carrier Oils

### The Problem

**CBD Is Fat-Soluble:**
- Doesn't dissolve in water
- Difficult to absorb alone
- Needs fat for transport
- Pure CBD hard to dose

### The Solution

**Carrier Oils:**
- Dilute concentrated CBD
- Enable consistent dosing
- Improve absorption
- Make products usable

---

## How Carrier Oils Work

### Absorption Mechanism

**Process:**
1. CBD dissolved in oil
2. You take the oil sublingually
3. Fats aid absorption
4. CBD enters bloodstream
5. Liver processes for systemic effects

### Why Fats Matter

- CBD binds to fat molecules
- Fat crosses intestinal barriers
- Improves bioavailability
- Protects CBD during digestion

## Carrier Oil Comparison

### Quick Reference

| Oil | Absorption | Taste | Shelf Life | Best For |
|-----|------------|-------|------------|----------|
| MCT | Highest | Neutral | Long | Most users |
| Hemp Seed | Moderate | Earthy | Shorter | Hemp enthusiasts |
| Olive | Moderate | Strong | Long | Mediterranean preference |
| Sunflower | Moderate | Mild | Moderate | Allergy concerns |
| Avocado | Good | Rich | Moderate | Premium products |

---

## Bioavailability Differences

### What Research Shows

**MCT Oil:**
- Fastest absorption
- Doesn't require bile for digestion
- Goes directly to liver
- Highest bioavailability among common carriers

**Long-Chain Triglycerides (Olive, Hemp Seed):**
- Slower absorption
- Require more digestion
- Still effective
- May be gentler

### What This Means

The carrier oil affects how much CBD actually reaches your bloodstream, but all carriers work—some are just more efficient.

---

## Taste Considerations

### If Taste Matters to You

**Mildest Options:**
1. MCT oil (nearly tasteless)
2. Sunflower oil
3. Avocado oil

**Strongest Options:**
1. Hemp seed oil
2. Olive oil

### Tip

If you dislike CBD oil taste, an MCT carrier with a flavoured product may work best.

---

## Allergies and Sensitivities

### Coconut/MCT

**Consider If:**
- Coconut allergy (rare but exists)
- Digestive sensitivity

**Alternatives:**
- Sunflower oil
- Olive oil
- Hemp seed oil

### Tree Nut Concerns

Most carrier oils are safe for tree nut allergies, but check sourcing if concerned.

## Which Carrier Should You Choose?

### Decision Guide

**Choose MCT If:**
- Want best absorption
- Prefer neutral taste
- No coconut sensitivity
- Taking sublingually

**Choose Hemp Seed If:**
- Want "whole hemp" experience
- Like nutty taste
- Value omega fatty acids
- Accept shorter shelf life

**Choose Olive If:**
- Prefer familiar oil
- Like Mediterranean diet
- Using in food too
- Accept strong taste

- Have allergies to consider
- Want mild taste
- Sensitive stomach
- Budget conscious

## Storage Considerations

### By Carrier Type

| Oil | Storage | Shelf Life |
|-----|---------|------------|
| MCT | Room temp or cool | 1-2 years |
| Hemp Seed | Refrigerate after opening | 6-12 months |
| Olive | Room temp, dark | 1-2 years |
| Sunflower | Room temp or cool | 6-12 months |

### General Rules

- Keep sealed
- Store in dark
- Avoid heat
- Check for rancidity

---

## Making Your Own CBD Oil

### If DIY Interest

**Considerations:**
- Use food-grade carrier
- Calculate CBD concentration
- Ensure even mixing
- Store properly

**Common Choice:**
MCT oil is easiest for DIY due to thin consistency and easy mixing.

---

## My Take

For most people, MCT oil is the best carrier—it has the highest bioavailability, neutral taste, and long shelf life. Hemp seed oil makes sense if you want the "hemp on hemp" experience and additional omega fatty acids, but accept it has a stronger taste and shorter shelf life. The carrier matters less than the CBD quality inside, so choose based on your taste preferences and any allergy considerations, then focus on the CBD itself.
