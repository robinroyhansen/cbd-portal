## My Take

Content creation is demanding work that combines creative pressure with business stress. CBD can help manage the anxiety that often accompanies this work—the fear of posting, the comparison spiral, the burnout cycle. The key is using it strategically: lighter doses when you need to create, more when you need to genuinely rest. It's not a creativity enhancer, but it can remove barriers to the creativity that's already there.
