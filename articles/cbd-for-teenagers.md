## Quick Summary

CBD use in teenagers raises unique considerations. While prescription CBD (Epidiolex) is approved for certain pediatric epilepsies, general CBD use in teens isn't recommended without medical supervision. Here's what parents need to know.

## The Developing Brain

## Key Takeaways

1. **Developing brain** requires caution
2. **Medical CBD** exists for specific conditions
3. **Not recommended** for general teen use
4. **Address underlying** concerns directly
5. **Involve healthcare** provider when needed

## My Take

I understand teens face significant pressures—anxiety, academic stress, social challenges. CBD might seem like an easy solution. But the developing brain deserves special consideration, and we don't have long-term safety data for adolescent CBD use.

If your teenager is struggling with anxiety, depression, or sleep issues, those deserve proper attention through therapy, lifestyle changes, or medical evaluation if needed—not self-medication with CBD.
