## Common First Week Mistakes

**Result:** Side effects, poor assessment
**Fix:** Start with 10-15mg regardless of "suggested serving"

**Result:** Can't assess properly
**Fix:** Same dose, same time, every day

### Mistake 3: Expecting Too Much

**Problem:** Looking for dramatic effects

**Fix:** Track subtle changes, think weeks not days

### Mistake 4: Not Tracking

**Problem:** Relying on memory

## My Take

Your first week is really just about starting—not about results. Most people don't notice much in the first seven days, and that's completely normal. The point is to establish your routine, note your baseline, and see if your body tolerates CBD well. Real assessment happens over weeks 2-4. If you feel something positive in week 1, great. If you feel nothing, stay the course. The only reason to stop in week 1 is significant side effects or concerns.
