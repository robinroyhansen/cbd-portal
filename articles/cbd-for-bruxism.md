## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD may reduce** grinding intensity
2. **Night guard** still essential for protection
3. **Stress management** addresses root cause
4. **Evening dosing** most relevant
5. **Comprehensive approach** most effective

---

## My Take

Bruxism is often closely tied to stress and anxiety, which is where CBD shows real potential. By addressing the stress component, CBD may help reduce the intensity and frequency of grinding, even if it doesn't stop it completely.

But don't skip the night guard because you're taking CBD. Teeth damage is permanent, and even reduced grinding can cause problems over time. Think of CBD as helping with the cause (stress, muscle tension) while the night guard protects from the consequences (tooth damage).
