## Key Takeaways

1. **Sleep support** is primary benefit
2. **Exam anxiety** may be helped
3. **Low doses** if using during day
4. **Know campus** policies
5. **Not a substitute** for preparation

## My Take

Student stress is real, and I think CBD is a reasonable option for managing it—certainly better than some alternatives students might turn to. The biggest benefit is probably sleep support during stressful periods.

Be realistic: CBD won't help you pass exams you didn't study for. But if anxiety is preventing you from accessing what you know, or if stress is destroying your sleep, CBD might help with those specific issues.
