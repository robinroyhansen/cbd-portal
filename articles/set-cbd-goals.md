## Quick Summary

Setting clear goals for CBD use helps you choose the right products, measure effectiveness, and adjust your approach appropriately. Goals should be specific, measurable, realistic, and focused on wellness outcomes you can actually track. Vague goals like "feel better" make it impossible to know if CBD is working for you.

## Goal-Setting Process

### Step 1: Identify Your Primary Concern

**Ask Yourself:**

### Step 2: Baseline Assessment

**Before Starting CBD:**
- Rate your current state (1-10)
- Document frequency of issues
- Note current limitations
- Record how you feel now

### Step 3: Set Specific Targets

**Define Success:**
- What rating would satisfy you?
- How much improvement is realistic?
- What would meaningful change look like?
- How will you know it's working?

### Step 4: Choose Timeframe

**Reasonable Periods:**
- Initial assessment: 2-4 weeks
- Meaningful evaluation: 4-8 weeks
- Long-term assessment: 3 months

## Common Mistakes

**Too Many:**
- 10 different goals → Can't track
- Everything at once → Confusing

**Too Impatient:**
- "Work immediately" → Not how CBD works
- "Know in 3 days" → Too short

## My Take

Goals transform CBD from "taking something and hoping" to "testing a hypothesis." When you know what you're trying to achieve and how you'll measure it, you can objectively assess whether CBD works for you. Start with one or two primary goals, track honestly, and give it adequate time. The clarity goals provide is the difference between informed decision-making and just guessing.
