## Quick Summary

To convert CBD percentage to mg per ml, multiply the percentage by 10. So 5% CBD = 50mg per ml, 10% CBD = 100mg per ml. This simple formula helps you understand product strength and calculate accurate doses, especially for European products that often label CBD as a percentage.

## Key Takeaways

- Percentage × 10 = mg per ml
- 5% = 50mg/ml, 10% = 100mg/ml
- European labels often use %
- US/UK labels often use mg
- Both measure the same thing differently

---

## The Simple Formula

### Converting Percentage to mg/ml

**Formula:**
```
mg per ml = Percentage × 10
```

**Why This Works:**
- Percentage means grams per 100ml
- 1 gram = 1000mg
- So 5% = 5g/100ml = 5000mg/100ml = 50mg/ml

## Quick Conversion Table

### Common Percentages

| CBD % | mg per ml | In 10ml Bottle | In 30ml Bottle |
|-------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| 2.5% | 25mg/ml | 250mg total | 750mg total |
| 5% | 50mg/ml | 500mg total | 1500mg total |
| 10% | 100mg/ml | 1000mg total | 3000mg total |
| 15% | 150mg/ml | 1500mg total | 4500mg total |
| 20% | 200mg/ml | 2000mg total | 6000mg total |
| 25% | 250mg/ml | 2500mg total | 7500mg total |
| 30% | 300mg/ml | 3000mg total | 9000mg total |

## Understanding the Labels

### European Style

**Typically Shows:**
- CBD: 10%
- Or "100mg/ml"
- Often in smaller bottles (10ml)

### UK/US Style

**Typically Shows:**
- Total CBD: 1000mg
- Bottle size: 30ml
- May not show per-ml or percentage

### Converting Between

**From % to Total:**
```
Total mg = % × 10 × bottle size (ml)
```

**From Total to %:**
```
% = (Total mg ÷ bottle size) ÷ 10
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Finding Total CBD

**Label Shows:** 5% CBD, 30ml bottle
**Calculate:** 5 × 10 × 30 = 1500mg total
**Result:** This bottle contains 1500mg CBD

### Example 2: Finding Percentage

**Label Shows:** 1000mg in 30ml
**Calculate:** (1000 ÷ 30) ÷ 10 = 3.33%
**Result:** This is approximately 3.3% CBD

### Example 3: Comparing Products

**Product A:** 10% CBD, 10ml = 1000mg total
**Product B:** 1000mg CBD, 30ml = 3.3%
**Same Total:** But A is more concentrated

---

## Why Concentration Matters

### High vs Low Concentration

**High Concentration (15-30%):**
- Less volume per dose
- More convenient
- Often better value per mg
- Stronger taste

**Low Concentration (2.5-5%):**
- More volume per dose
- Easier to measure small doses
- Often gentler taste
- Good for beginners

### Example Dose Comparison

**For 25mg Dose:**

| CBD Strength | Volume Needed |
|--------------|---------------|
| 5% (50mg/ml) | 0.5ml (half dropper) |
| 10% (100mg/ml) | 0.25ml (quarter dropper) |
| 20% (200mg/ml) | 0.125ml (small amount) |

## Calculating Your Dose

### Step-by-Step

**1. Find Your Product's mg/ml:**
- If percentage: multiply by 10
- If total/bottle: divide total by ml

**2. Determine Desired Dose (mg):**
- Beginner: 10-20mg
- Moderate: 20-40mg
- Higher: 40mg+

**3. Calculate Volume Needed:**
```
Volume (ml) = Desired dose (mg) ÷ mg per ml
```

**4. Measure Using Dropper:**
- Full dropper ≈ 1ml
- Half dropper ≈ 0.5ml

---

## Dose Calculation Examples

### Low Dose Example

**Want:** 15mg
**Product:** 5% (50mg/ml)
**Calculate:** 15 ÷ 50 = 0.3ml
**Measure:** About 1/3 of a dropper

### Medium Dose Example

**Want:** 30mg
**Product:** 10% (100mg/ml)
**Calculate:** 30 ÷ 100 = 0.3ml
**Measure:** About 1/3 of a dropper

### Higher Dose Example

**Want:** 50mg
**Product:** 20% (200mg/ml)
**Calculate:** 50 ÷ 200 = 0.25ml
**Measure:** About 1/4 of a dropper

---

## Comparing Products by Value

### Cost Per mg Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Cost per mg = Price ÷ Total mg
```

**Example Comparison:**

| Product | Price | CBD % | Size | Total mg | Cost/mg |
|---------|-------|-------|------|----------|---------|
| A | £40 | 5% | 10ml | 500mg | £0.08 |
| B | £60 | 10% | 30ml | 3000mg | £0.02 |
| C | £80 | 20% | 10ml | 2000mg | £0.04 |

**Best Value:** Product B (lowest cost per mg)

## Common Confusion Points

### Percentage vs. Total

**Not the Same:**
- 10% in 10ml = 1000mg total
- 10% in 30ml = 3000mg total
- Same concentration, different amounts

### Label Variations

**May Be Listed As:**
- "10% CBD"
- "100mg/ml"
- "1000mg per 10ml"
- All mean the same thing

### "CBD Oil" vs. Carrier

The percentage refers to CBD in the total solution (CBD + carrier oil), not pure CBD content of the hemp extract.

## Making Your Reference

### Personal Cheat Sheet

**My Product:**
- Brand: ___________
- Percentage: _____%
- mg per ml: _____mg
- Bottle size: _____ml
- Total CBD: _____mg

**My Doses:**
- 10mg = _____ml
- 20mg = _____ml
- 30mg = _____ml

---

## My Take

The percentage vs. milligram confusion trips up many people, but it's really just two ways of saying the same thing. European products favour percentages; UK and US products favour total milligrams. Once you know that percentage × 10 = mg per ml, you can work with any product label. Do this calculation once when you buy a new product, and dosing becomes straightforward.
