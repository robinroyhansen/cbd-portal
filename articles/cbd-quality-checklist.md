## My Take

This checklist might seem like a lot of work, but doing it once or twice trains you to quickly spot quality products. After verifying a few good brands, you'll know what to look for and can shop confidently.

The most important check is COA availability and accuracy. If a company won't provide a COA or it doesn't match the label, move on—there are plenty of transparent companies making quality products.
