## Quick Summary

CBD research varies significantly in quality and relevance. Understanding study types—from in vitro and animal studies to human clinical trials—helps you evaluate evidence accurately. The strongest evidence comes from randomised controlled trials in humans, while preclinical research provides mechanistic insights.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Study type determines evidence strength
- Human trials most relevant for consumers
- Animal studies may not translate to humans
- Sample size and methodology matter
- Peer review adds credibility

---

## Study Hierarchy

### Levels of Evidence

**Strongest to Weakest:**

1. **Systematic Reviews/Meta-analyses**
   - Combine multiple studies
   - Statistical pooling
   - Highest evidence level

2. **Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)**
   - Gold standard
   - Placebo comparison
   - Randomised assignment

3. **Observational Studies**
   - Cohort, case-control
   - Real-world data
   - Less controlled

4. **Animal Studies**
   - Mechanism insights
   - May not translate
   - Preclinical evidence

5. **In Vitro Studies**
   - Lab/cell studies
   - Mechanism exploration
   - Least translatable

## In Vitro (Lab) Studies

### What They Are

**Cell-Based Research:**
- Conducted in test tubes/dishes
- Isolated cells or tissues
- Controlled conditions
- First exploration step

### Value and Limitations

**Value:**
- Identifies mechanisms
- Screens potential effects
- Low cost, fast
- Essential first step

**Limitations:**
- Not a living system
- Missing complexity
- Doses often unrealistic
- Poor prediction of human effects

### How to Interpret

- "CBD kills cancer cells in lab" ≠ cancer cure
- Provides direction for further research
- Cannot be applied to humans directly
- Many compounds work in vitro, fail in vivo

---

## Animal Studies

### What They Are

**In Vivo Research:**
- Whole organism testing
- Usually rodents
- Controlled conditions
- More complex than in vitro

### Value and Limitations

**Value:**
- Shows effects in living system
- Can study whole body
- Identifies toxicity
- Required before human trials

**Limitations:**
- Animals aren't humans
- Metabolism differences
- Dose translation complex
- Many don't translate

### Translation Problem

- Only ~8% of animal studies translate to humans
- Rodent CBD metabolism differs
- Stress of lab conditions
- Species-specific responses

---

## Human Clinical Trials

### Trial Phases

**Phase 1:**
- Safety and dosing
- Healthy volunteers usually
- Small numbers (20-100)
- First human testing

**Phase 2:**
- Efficacy signals
- Patients with condition
- Larger groups (100-300)
- Optimal dosing

**Phase 3:**
- Confirms efficacy
- Large groups (300-3000+)
- Multi-site usually
- Required for approval

**Phase 4:**
- Post-marketing
- Real-world effectiveness
- Long-term safety
- Ongoing monitoring

### What Makes Strong Trials

- Randomised assignment
- Placebo-controlled
- Double-blinded
- Adequate sample size
- Validated outcome measures
- Pre-registered protocol

## Reading Research

### Key Questions to Ask

**About Methods:**
- What type of study is this?
- How many participants?
- Was it placebo-controlled?
- Were researchers blinded?

**About Results:**
- What were actual outcomes?
- How large was the effect?
- Was it statistically significant?
- Was it clinically meaningful?

**About Context:**
- Who funded the study?
- Has it been replicated?
- What do other studies show?
- Is it peer-reviewed?

---

## Statistical Concepts

### P-Values

**What They Mean:**
- Probability result is due to chance
- p<0.05 typically "significant"
- Doesn't mean effect is large
- Can be misleading

### Effect Size

**More Important:**
- How big is the difference?
- Clinical relevance
- Practical significance
- Beyond statistical

### Confidence Intervals

- Range of likely true values
- Wider = less precise
- Helps assess uncertainty
- More informative than p-values

---

## Common Pitfalls

### In Headlines

**Watch For:**
- "Breakthrough" claims
- Single study emphasis
- Animal research overstated
- Correlation as causation

### In Studies

**Red Flags:**
- Industry-funded without disclosure
- Small sample sizes
- No placebo control
- Cherry-picked outcomes
- Not pre-registered

---

## CBD Research Landscape

### Current State

**Strong Evidence:**
- Epidiolex for epilepsy (RCTs)
- Safety data (multiple trials)
- Pharmacokinetics (well-studied)

**Promising Evidence:**
- Anxiety (some human trials)
- Pain (mixed results)
- Sleep (developing)

**Early Evidence:**
- Most conditions (preclinical)
- Many claims (animal only)
- Mechanisms (in vitro)

---

## Evaluating CBD Claims

### When You See Claims

1. What's the evidence type?
2. Human or animal study?
3. How many people/studies?
4. What doses were used?
5. Who funded it?
6. Has it been replicated?

### Healthy Scepticism

- Extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence
- Single studies aren't definitive
- Marketing ≠ science
- More research often needed

---

## Where to Find Research

### Reliable Sources

- PubMed (peer-reviewed)
- ClinicalTrials.gov (ongoing trials)
- Cochrane Reviews (systematic reviews)
- University research pages

### Less Reliable

- Company websites (biased)
- News headlines (oversimplified)
- Social media (unverified)
- Marketing materials

---

## My Take

Understanding research quality is essential for making informed CBD decisions. Most CBD marketing cites preclinical research that may not apply to humans. Epidiolex's FDA approval demonstrates that when proper human trials are conducted, CBD can meet rigorous evidence standards. For other claims, ask what level of evidence exists and whether it's in humans.
