## My Take

Swimming's unique combination of high-volume shoulder work and demanding schedules makes recovery crucial. CBD fits well into a swimmer's routine—supporting shoulder health, aiding sleep (especially important with early practices), and even helping with chlorine's effects on skin.

For competitive swimmers, stick with verified THC-free products. Your recovery matters, but so does your eligibility.
