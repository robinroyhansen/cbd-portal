## Why Lab Reports Matter

A Certificate of Analysis (COA) is your assurance that:
- The product contains what it claims
- THC levels are legal and as stated
- No harmful contaminants
- The company is transparent

**If a company won't provide lab reports, don't buy from them.**

## What to Look For: Quick Checklist

✓ **Third-party lab** (not in-house)
✓ **Recent date** (within 12 months)
✓ **Batch/lot number** (matches your product)
✓ **Cannabinoid profile** (CBD content accurate)
✓ **THC content** (within legal limits)
✓ **Contaminant testing** (pesticides, heavy metals, etc.)

## The Basics of a COA

### Lab Information

| What to Check | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Lab name** | Verify it's a real, accredited lab |
| **Lab accreditation** | ISO 17025 is gold standard |
| **Contact info** | Legitimate labs have verifiable details |
| **Report date** | Should be reasonably recent |

### Sample Information

| What to Check | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Product name** | Matches what you're buying |
| **Batch/lot number** | Matches number on your product |
| **Sample date** | When testing was done |
| **Report date** | When results were issued |

## Cannabinoid Profile

### Key Numbers to Check

**CBD Content:**
- Listed in mg/mL, mg/g, or percentage
- Should match product label (within ~10%)
- Example: 30mL bottle claiming 1000mg = ~33mg/mL

**THC Content:**
- Must be ≤0.3% (US) or ≤0.2% (EU)
- Listed as Delta-9 THC
- Total THC may also be shown
- "ND" (not detected) or "LOQ" (below limit of quantification) is ideal for THC-free claims

**Other Cannabinoids:**
- CBG, CBN, CBC, etc.
- Indicates full-spectrum if present
- Shows product complexity

### How to Verify CBD Content

**Calculation example:**
- Bottle: 30mL with 1500mg CBD claimed
- Lab report shows: 52mg/mL CBD
- 52 × 30 = 1560mg total
- Close to claimed 1500mg ✓ (acceptable variance)

**Red flag:**
- Label claims 1000mg
- Lab shows only 500mg
- Product is underdosed

## THC Content Details

### Understanding THC Numbers

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Delta-9 THC** | The primary psychoactive THC |
| **Total THC** | Delta-9 + (THCA × 0.877) |
| **ND** | Not detected |
| **LOQ** | Limit of quantification |
| **<LOQ** | Below detectable amount |

### Legal Compliance

For legal hemp products:
- Delta-9 THC must be ≤0.3% (US)
- Or ≤0.2% (EU/UK)
- "ND" or "<LOQ" means effectively THC-free

### If You're Drug Tested

- Look for "ND" or verified 0.0% THC
- Even ≤0.3% can accumulate with heavy use
- Broad-spectrum or isolate should show no THC
- Verify with lab report, don't trust label alone

---

## Contaminant Testing

### Pesticides

- Should show "ND" (not detected) or pass
- List of tested pesticides should be comprehensive
- Organic claims should align with pesticide results

### Heavy Metals

| Metal | Concern |
|-------|---------|
| **Lead** | Neurotoxic |
| **Mercury** | Neurotoxic |
| **Arsenic** | Carcinogenic |
| **Cadmium** | Kidney damage |

- All should be "ND" or below safe limits
- Hemp accumulates heavy metals from soil
- Testing is important

### Residual Solvents

If extracted using solvents:
- Ethanol, CO2, butane, propane
- Should be "ND" or well below limits
- CO2 extraction typically cleanest

### Microbial Contaminants

| Pathogen | Should Be |
|----------|-----------|
| **E. coli** | Not detected |
| **Salmonella** | Not detected |
| **Mold/yeast** | Below limits |
| **Total aerobic count** | Below limits |

### Mycotoxins

- Produced by mold
- Should be "ND" or below limits
- Particularly important for immunocompromised

## Red Flags

### Warning Signs

❌ **No lab report available**
❌ **In-house testing only** (not third-party)
❌ **Very old report** (>12 months)
❌ **Batch numbers don't match**
❌ **CBD content significantly different from label**
❌ **THC above legal limit**
❌ **Contaminants detected** (unless below safe limits)
❌ **Missing tests** (only cannabinoids, no contaminants)

### Questions to Ask If Concerned

- Can I see the full COA?
- Is this from a third-party lab?
- Can you provide the lab's contact info?
- Does this match my product's batch number?

## How to Find Lab Reports

### Where to Look

1. **Product packaging** — QR code often links to COA
2. **Company website** — Usually under "Lab Results" or "Certificates"
3. **Ask customer service** — Email with batch number
4. **Third-party databases** — Some labs publish directly

### If You Can't Find Them

- Contact company directly
- Reputable companies provide easily
- Hesitation or refusal = red flag
- Consider different brand

## Understanding Lab Terminology

### Common Terms

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **ND** | Not Detected |
| **LOQ** | Limit of Quantification |
| **LOD** | Limit of Detection |
| **mg/mL** | Milligrams per milliliter |
| **mg/g** | Milligrams per gram |
| **ppm** | Parts per million |
| **%** | Percentage by weight |
| **Pass/Fail** | Meets/doesn't meet standard |
| **CFU/g** | Colony forming units per gram (microbial) |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always check lab reports** before buying
2. **Third-party testing** is essential
3. **Match batch numbers** to your product
4. **Verify CBD content** matches label claims
5. **Check THC levels** especially if drug tested
6. **Contaminant testing** protects your health
7. **No COA = no purchase**

## My Take

Reading lab reports isn't as complicated as it seems once you know what to look for. The most important things: verify CBD matches the label (within ~10%), THC is legal/as claimed, and contaminants are "ND" or passing.

If a company makes getting their COA difficult, that's a red flag. Reputable brands make these easily accessible—they're proud of their testing.

For drug-tested individuals, scrutinize THC numbers carefully. "Full-spectrum" products will have some THC. Look for "ND" if you need truly THC-free.

This 5-minute review of a COA can save you from underdosed products, THC surprises, or contaminated products. It's worth the effort.
