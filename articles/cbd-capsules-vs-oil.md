- Start low if switching

### When Switching

## Key Takeaways

1. **Oil is faster** and more flexible
2. **Capsules are more convenient** and tasteless
3. **Bioavailability differs** (oil higher sublingual)
4. **Choose based on priorities**
5. **Many people use both** for different situations

## My Take

Neither is objectively "better"—it depends on what you value. I personally use oil for its flexibility and faster onset, but I keep capsules for travel. The convenience of capsules is hard to beat for busy lifestyles.

If you're new to CBD, capsules make starting easier—exact doses, no measuring, no taste. Once you know CBD works for you, you might explore oil for more control.
