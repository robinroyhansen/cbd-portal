## Common Fatal Mistakes

**Wrong:**
- Personal use still prosecuted
- Still faces prison time
- Distinction doesn't help much
- Don't bring any amount

### "It's Natural/Herbal"

**Wrong:**
- Natural doesn't mean legal
- Indonesia doesn't recognize this
- CBD is still classified narcotic
- Marketing terms irrelevant

### "I'll Hide It"

**Catastrophically wrong:**
- Customs uses dogs, scanners
- Discovery = serious charges
- Concealment worsens situation
- Not worth your freedom/life

### "Tourists Are Treated Differently"

**Wrong:**
- Foreigners are prosecuted
- Foreigners have been executed
- No special treatment
- Local law applies to all

## Will Laws Change?

### No Change Expected

**Indonesia's position:**
- Strong anti-drug stance
- Part of national policy
- Religious and cultural factors
- No reform movements gaining ground

### Don't Wait for Change

**Current reality:**
- Laws are what they are
- Plan according to current rules
- No imminent softening
- Respect local laws

## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD is completely illegal** in Indonesia
2. **Penalties include death** for trafficking
3. **No exemptions exist** — none at all
4. **Bali follows same laws**
5. **Do NOT bring CBD** — your freedom depends on it
6. **Don't buy locally** — black market is extremely dangerous

## My Take

I cannot stress this strongly enough: Indonesia is not a place to take any risks with CBD. The penalties are among the harshest in the world, including execution for trafficking. People have lost decades of their lives to Indonesian prisons over cannabis products.

If you're going to Bali or anywhere in Indonesia and you use CBD, you must go without. Remove every trace of CBD from your belongings. Check everything multiple times. The consequences of getting this wrong are not a fine or confiscation—they're potentially life-destroying.

This is not fear-mongering. Indonesia's drug laws are exactly as strict as I'm describing, and they enforce them.
