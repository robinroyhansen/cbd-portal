## My Take

When you've tried everything and nothing works, the desperation is real. CBD might genuinely help—it does for many people. But I won't promise it will work, because that would be dishonest.

What I can say: CBD is generally safe, has evidence for several conditions, and is worth trying with realistic expectations. Give it a proper chance with quality products and adequate time. If it helps even somewhat, that's valuable. If it doesn't, at least you know you tried.
