## My Take

These are fundamentally different options. Gabapentin is a proven medication that doctors prescribe for good reasons—it works for many people with nerve pain. CBD is a gentler option that may help some people, particularly those with milder symptoms or those who can't tolerate medications.

If you're taking gabapentin and interested in CBD, don't make changes without talking to your doctor. If you're exploring options for new nerve pain, your doctor can help determine what's appropriate for your situation.
