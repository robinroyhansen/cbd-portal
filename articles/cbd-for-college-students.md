College is stressful, and CBD can be one tool in managing that stress. It's not a magic study aid—nothing replaces sleep, good habits, and actual studying. But for managing anxiety and improving sleep, CBD is reasonable.

Know your university's policies, especially if you're an athlete. Don't let CBD become a crutch—develop real coping skills alongside any supplements.
