## My Take

CBD and keto work well together. Most CBD oils are in MCT carrier, which is actually beneficial for ketosis. The main thing to watch is sugary products—gummies and edibles that could impact your carb count.

If you're strict keto, stick to CBD oil in MCT carrier or pure isolate. These have essentially zero carbs and fit perfectly into a ketogenic lifestyle.
