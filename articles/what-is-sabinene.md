## My Take

Sabinene is a background terpene that adds warmth and complexity. When I encounter CBD products with that pleasant peppery-spicy note, sabinene is often present alongside caryophyllene. It's not a terpene I specifically seek out, but its presence indicates a diverse terpene profile that tends to characterize quality products.
