## Key Takeaways

3. **Sleep despite** late hours
4. **Not during** active service
5. **Part of** sustainable career approach

## My Take

Kitchen work is uniquely demanding—physically brutal, mentally intense, and often culturally unhealthy. CBD can support the physical recovery that makes this work sustainable and the sleep that's hard to achieve after late, high-adrenaline service.

The industry is slowly changing its relationship with substances. CBD offers a legal, non-impairing option that supports wellbeing rather than just masking pain or stress. It's a tool for building a sustainable culinary career, not for enabling an unsustainable one.
