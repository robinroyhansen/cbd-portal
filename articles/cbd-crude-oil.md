## Quick Summary

CBD crude oil is the raw, unrefined extract obtained directly from hemp plants after initial extraction. It contains CBD along with other cannabinoids, terpenes, waxes, chlorophyll, and plant matter—giving it a dark colour and strong taste. Crude oil is typically refined into distillate or other products rather than used directly by consumers.

## Key Takeaways

- Raw, unrefined hemp extract
- Contains full plant profile
- Dark colour, strong taste
- Usually refined before consumer use
- Basis for other CBD products

## What Is CBD Crude Oil?

### Definition

CBD crude oil (also called "crude extract" or "raw extract") is the initial product of extracting cannabinoids from hemp. It's the starting material before further refinement.

### Appearance

**Characteristics:**
- Very dark (brown to black)
- Thick, tar-like consistency
- Opaque
- Strong smell

### Composition

**Contains:**
- CBD (15-50% typically)
- Other cannabinoids (CBG, CBN, etc.)
- Terpenes
- Chlorophyll
- Plant waxes and lipids
- Plant matter
- Potentially fats and oils

## How CBD Crude Oil Is Made

### Extraction Process

**Common Methods:**

**CO2 Extraction:**
- Supercritical CO2 as solvent
- Produces cleaner crude
- Industry standard

**Ethanol Extraction:**
- Ethanol dissolves cannabinoids
- Full-spectrum extraction
- May include more chlorophyll

**Hydrocarbon Extraction:**
- Butane or propane
- Requires purging
- Efficient extraction

### What Comes Out

The result is everything extractable from the plant—cannabinoids, terpenes, and plant materials all combined.

## CBD Crude vs. Other Extracts

### Comparison

| Factor | Crude | Distillate | Isolate |
|--------|-------|------------|---------|
| Processing | Minimal | Significant | Maximum |
| Purity | 15-50% CBD | 80-95% CBD | 99%+ CBD |
| Colour | Dark | Golden | White |
| Taste | Very strong | Moderate | None |
| Other compounds | Many | Some | None |
| Consumer use | Rare | Common | Common |

### Crude Oil's Place

Crude is the raw material that becomes distillate, isolate, and finished products through further processing.

## Why Crude Oil Isn't for Consumers

### Reasons

**1. Potency Inconsistency:**
- Variable CBD content
- Hard to dose accurately
- Batch variation common

**2. Taste and Appearance:**
- Very strong, unpleasant taste
- Dark, unappealing colour
- Difficult to consume

**3. Contaminants:**
- May contain plant waxes
- Chlorophyll present
- Not suitable for vaping
- May have residual solvents

**4. Requires Refinement:**
- Not a finished product
- Needs further processing
- Testing less standardised

---

## The Refinement Process

### From Crude to Finished Products

**Step 1: Winterisation**
- Mixed with ethanol
- Frozen
- Waxes and fats filtered out

**Step 2: Decarboxylation**
- Heated to activate cannabinoids
- CBDA converts to CBD

**Step 3: Distillation**
- Purified through distillation
- Separates compounds
- Creates CBD distillate

**Step 4: Further Processing (Optional)**
- Chromatography for isolation
- THC removal for broad-spectrum
- Creates various end products

## Why Crude Oil Matters

### Industry Foundation

**Importance:**
- Starting point for all CBD products
- Quality affects final products
- Source material matters
- Supply chain essential

### Quality Indicators

**Good Crude:**
- From quality hemp
- Proper extraction methods
- Known cannabinoid content
- Clean extraction process

**Poor Crude:**
- Unknown source
- Improper extraction
- Contaminants present
- Variable quality

---

## Full-Spectrum "Crude" Products

### Some Products Labelled Crude

**What They May Mean:**
- Minimally processed
- "Raw" extract
- Full plant profile
- Not refined

**Consumer Considerations:**
- Verify what's actually in it
- Check testing
- Understand what you're buying
- May have strong taste

---

## Crude Oil for DIY

### Rare but Possible

**Some Users Buy Crude For:**
- Making own products
- Cost savings
- Full plant experience
- Educational purposes

**Challenges:**
- Requires processing knowledge
- Hard to dose
- Strong taste
- Quality verification difficult

---

## Testing Crude Oil

### What Should Be Tested

**Essential:**
- Cannabinoid profile
- Pesticides
- Heavy metals
- Residual solvents
- Microbial

**Why Crude Testing Matters:**
- Sets baseline for refinement
- Identifies contamination early
- Ensures safety
- Quality control

---

## Crude Oil in the Supply Chain

### Industry Perspective

**Flow:**
1. Hemp cultivation
2. Extraction → Crude oil
3. Refinement → Distillate
4. Further processing → Isolate/products
5. Finished goods → Consumers

**Crude Oil Role:**
- Traded between companies
- Bulk commodity
- Foundation of industry
- Quality varies significantly

---

## Should You Use CBD Crude?

### Generally No

**For Most Consumers:**
- Refined products are better
- Easier to dose
- More pleasant to use
- Properly tested

### Possibly If

**Unusual Circumstances:**
- Making your own products (professionally)
- Educational purposes
- Very specific needs
- Have processing capability

## My Take

CBD crude oil is an industry product, not a consumer product. It's the raw material that gets refined into the CBD products people actually use. Some companies market "crude" or "raw" extracts to consumers, which is fine if properly tested and you understand what you're getting. But for most people, refined products like distillate-based oils or isolate formulations are more practical, more pleasant, and easier to dose. Think of crude like crude petroleum—important in the supply chain, but you don't put it directly in your car.
