## My Take

Sales is uniquely stressful—your income depends on your performance, and rejection is built into the job. CBD can help manage the anxiety that makes rejection harder and performance pressure more overwhelming.

The goal isn't to dull your edge but to remove the counterproductive anxiety that interferes with performance. Good salespeople need energy and presence; CBD at appropriate doses helps maintain these while reducing the background stress that can make sales harder than it needs to be.
