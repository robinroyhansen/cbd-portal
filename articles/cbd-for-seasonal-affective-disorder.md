## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD isn't** primary SAD treatment
2. **May help** some symptoms like mood and sleep
3. **Light therapy** is evidence-based first-line
4. **Professional help** for moderate-severe SAD
5. **Comprehensive approach** most effective

## My Take

SAD is a real medical condition that deserves proper treatment. Light therapy and sometimes medication are the evidence-based approaches. CBD may help at the margins—supporting mood and sleep quality—but shouldn't be your primary strategy.

If you have SAD, use light therapy, consider professional guidance, and think of CBD as a supporting player, not the main treatment. The combination of proven approaches with supportive tools like CBD may help you navigate winter better than CBD alone.
