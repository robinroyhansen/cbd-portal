## Quick Summary

There's no universal CBD dose—it varies by individual, purpose, and product. This guide provides frameworks for finding your optimal dosage through systematic titration, considering factors like body weight, severity of concern, and delivery method.

## Why Dosing Varies

### Individual Factors

What affects your dose:
- Body weight
- Metabolism
- Severity of concern
- Individual sensitivity
- Product quality
- Delivery method

### No One-Size-Fits-All

Reality:
- Someone may need 10mg
- Another may need 100mg
- Both can be appropriate
- Personal experimentation needed

## Starting Point Recommendations

### By Body Weight

General starting doses:
| Weight | Starting Daily Dose |
|--------|---------------------|
| Under 130 lbs | 10-15mg |
| 130-230 lbs | 15-25mg |
| Over 230 lbs | 25-35mg |

### By Purpose

Common starting points:
| Purpose | Suggested Start |

## The Titration Method

### Step 1: Start Low

Begin:
- Choose starting dose (from tables)
- Use for 1 week
- Track effects

### Step 2: Assess

After one week:
- Are you feeling benefits?
- Any side effects?
- Room for improvement?

### Step 3: Adjust

If needed:
- Increase by 5-10mg
- Give another week
- Repeat until optimal

### Step 4: Maintain

Once effective:
- Stay at that dose
- Adjust if needed later
- Less is more (minimum effective)

- Slower onset
- Consistent delivery

### Topical

- Reapply as needed
- Not systemic

### Vaping

Characteristics:

## Calculating Product Doses

### For CBD Oil

Formula:
- Total mg ÷ ml in bottle = mg per ml
- mg per ml ÷ drops per ml = mg per drop

**Example:**
- 1000mg CBD in 30ml bottle
- = 33.3mg per ml
- ~20 drops per ml = ~1.7mg per drop
- 10 drops ≈ 17mg CBD

### For Capsules/Gummies

Simpler:
- Each piece has set dose
- Listed on packaging
- Just count pieces

---

## Timing Considerations

### Split Dosing

Options:
- Once daily (simpler)
- Twice daily (more consistent levels)
- Three times (for higher doses)

### When to Take

Guidance:
- Anxiety: Morning and/or as needed
- Sleep: 1-2 hours before bed
- Pain: Consistent schedule
- Wellness: With meals

---

## Tracking Your Response

### What to Record

Track daily:
- Dose taken
- Time taken
- Effects noticed
- Any side effects
- Sleep quality
- Overall rating

### Why Track

Benefits:
- Identifies optimal dose
- Shows patterns
- Prevents over/underdosing
- Guides adjustments

---

## Signs You Need to Adjust

### Dose Too Low

Indicators:
- No noticeable effect
- Symptoms unchanged
- After 2+ weeks of consistent use

**Action:** Increase by 5-10mg

### Dose Too High

Indicators:
- Excessive drowsiness
- Digestive upset
- Feeling foggy

**Action:** Reduce by 5-10mg

---

## Maximum Considerations

### Upper Limits

Research suggests:
- Doses up to 300-600mg used in studies
- Most people need much less
- Higher doses not always better
- Diminishing returns possible

### Practical Maximum

For most:
- 100-150mg daily sufficient
- Beyond this, reassess approach
- Consider consultation
- Quality may be issue if not working

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start low** (10-25mg depending on factors)
2. **Increase gradually** (5-10mg at a time)
3. **Give time** (1-2 weeks before adjusting)
4. **Track your response**
5. **Find minimum effective dose**
6. **Delivery method affects amount needed**

---

## My Take

Finding your optimal CBD dose requires patience. Start lower than you think you need, increase slowly, and pay attention to your body. Most people find their sweet spot somewhere between 25-75mg daily, but this varies widely.

The goal is minimum effective dose—the smallest amount that gives you the benefits you're looking for. More isn't necessarily better, and starting low helps you find that optimal point without overshooting.
