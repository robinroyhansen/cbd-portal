## Key Takeaways

- Myrcene is the most sedating common cannabis terpene
- Linalool (lavender terpene) has strong sleep research support
- Look for these terpenes in CBD products for nighttime use
- Avoid alerting terpenes (pinene, limonene) before bed
- Terpene combinations may be more effective than single terpenes

## Top Terpenes for Sleep

### 1. Myrcene — The Primary Sleep Terpene

**Why it helps:**
- Most abundant cannabis terpene
- Documented sedative effects in animal studies
- Muscle-relaxing properties
- Often dominant in "indica" type strains

**Research highlights:**
- Studies show sedative and motor relaxant effects
- May enhance other sedatives' effects
- Traditional use in sleep aids (hops contain myrcene)

**What to look for:**
- Myrcene content >0.3%
- Listed as dominant terpene
- Earthy, musky aroma

### 2. Linalool — The Lavender Connection

**Why it helps:**
- Primary terpene in lavender
- Well-researched anxiolytic and sedative effects
- GABA modulation (like some sleep medications)
- Reduces sleep latency (time to fall asleep)

**Research highlights:**
- Human studies support lavender aromatherapy for sleep
- Silexan (lavender oil) approved for anxiety in Germany
- ICU studies show improved sleep with lavender

**What to look for:**
- Linalool present in profile
- Floral notes in aroma
- Products marketed for sleep

### 3. Terpinolene — The Paradoxical Sedative

**Why it helps:**
- Research shows sedative effects despite "sativa" classification
- May provide unique sedation pathway
- Found in some relaxing strains

**Research highlights:**
- Animal studies demonstrate sedative properties
- Less common but potentially valuable
- May complement other sleep terpenes

**What to look for:**
- Rarely dominant
- Contributes to complex profiles
- Herbal, floral aroma

### 4. Nerolidol — The Deep Relaxer

**Why it helps:**
- Sesquiterpene with sedative research
- Enhances penetration of other compounds
- Woody, relaxing aroma

## Terpenes to Avoid Before Bed

### Pinene

- Associated with alertness and focus
- May counteract sedating effects
- Keep levels low in nighttime products

### Limonene

## Creating the Ideal Sleep Profile

### Optimal Combination

The best sleep products often feature:
- **Dominant:** Myrcene
- **Secondary:** Linalool
- **Supporting:** Terpinolene, nerolidol
- **Limited:** Pinene, limonene

### Total Terpene Content

- Higher isn't always better
- 1-3% total terpenes is common in quality products
- Profile matters more than total content

### Why the Combination Works

- Terpenes provide direct sedative effects
- Entourage effect enhances overall impact
- Multiple mechanisms of action

### Product Recommendations

Look for:
- Full-spectrum CBD with myrcene-dominant profile
- Products specifically formulated for sleep
- Evening-focused formulations
- Added CBN (cannabinoid with sleep research)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will these terpenes make me groggy in the morning?

At typical CBD product levels, probably not. Effects are generally subtler than pharmaceutical sleep aids. However, higher-dose products or sensitive individuals might experience some morning grogginess.

### Can I use terpene aromatherapy alongside CBD?

Yes, many people combine CBD products with lavender aromatherapy for enhanced sleep support. The approaches complement each other.

### How long before bed should I take terpene-rich CBD?

30-60 minutes before bed for sublingual products, 1-2 hours for edibles. This allows effects to onset as you're trying to sleep.

### Are synthetic terpenes as effective for sleep?

Potentially. The molecules are identical. However, some evidence suggests natural combinations may work better together. If cost is a concern, quality synthetic terpenes in appropriate ratios can still be effective.

## My Take

For sleep, I always prioritise myrcene and linalool content. These two terpenes have the strongest evidence for sedative effects, and products featuring them simply work better for my evening routine. When clients ask about CBD for sleep, checking the terpene profile is my first step—high-CBD content means little if the terpene profile is alerting rather than sedating.
