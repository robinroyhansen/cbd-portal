## Quick Summary

Highly Sensitive People (HSPs) process stimuli more deeply, often experiencing overwhelm from environments, emotions, and sensory input. CBD may help HSPs manage overstimulation, reduce anxiety, and support nervous system regulation.

## Understanding High Sensitivity

### What Is HSP?

- Strong emotional responses
- Affected by others' moods
- Need more downtime
- Sensitive to noise, light, touch

## How CBD May Help HSPs

### Nervous System Support

Calming effects:
- Helps regulate nervous system
- Reduces hyperarousal
- Calmer baseline state
- Less reactive to stimuli

### Overwhelm Management

When overstimulated:
- CBD may reduce intensity
- Faster return to calm
- Better recovery
- More manageable days

### Anxiety Reduction

Common for HSPs:
- Anxiety often accompanies sensitivity
- CBD's anxiolytic effects
- Less anticipatory worry
- Calmer in challenging situations

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start very low**—HSPs often need less
2. **Simple products** with few additives
3. **Nervous system** regulation is key benefit
4. **Track carefully**—you may be more sensitive
5. **Honor sensitivity**—CBD supports, doesn't change

---

## My Take

HSPs often find relief with CBD because it helps regulate the nervous system that's working overtime in sensitive people. The key is starting very low—HSPs may need much less CBD than average to get benefits, and may also be more sensitive to side effects.

Choose simple, clean products and pay close attention to your response. CBD can be a valuable tool for managing the overstimulation that comes with high sensitivity, helping you function in a world that isn't designed for sensitive nervous systems.
