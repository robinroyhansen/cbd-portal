## Key Takeaways

1. **Test protocol** before actual exams
2. **Moderate doses** to maintain clarity
3. **Timing matters**—1-2 hours before
4. **Study period** CBD can help sleep
5. **No substitute** for actual preparation

## My Take

CBD can help manage the anxiety that prevents students from demonstrating what they actually know. The worst feeling is blanking on material you studied thoroughly—CBD may help prevent that anxiety-induced block.

But the foundation is still preparation. CBD helps you access what you've learned by reducing anxiety; it doesn't create knowledge you don't have. Use it as part of a complete approach that starts with genuine study.
