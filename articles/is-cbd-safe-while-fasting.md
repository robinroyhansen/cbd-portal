## Quick Summary

Pure CBD oil likely doesn't significantly break a fast due to minimal calories and no insulin response, but it depends on your fasting goals. The carrier oil in CBD products contains some calories. For medical fasts (pre-surgery, blood tests), CBD should typically be avoided. For wellness fasting, pure CBD is generally compatible.

## Will CBD Break Your Fast?

### The Calorie Question

**Pure CBD:**
- Essentially zero calories
- No protein or carbs
- No insulin response
- Technically doesn't break fast

**Carrier Oil:**
- MCT oil: ~8 calories per ml
- Most doses: 10-40 calories
- May not break metabolic fast
- Depends on strictness

### By Fasting Type

| Fasting Type | CBD Compatible? |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Medical (pre-surgery) | No |
| Blood test fast | No |
| Strict caloric fast | Minimal impact |
| Intermittent fasting | Usually yes |
| Autophagy-focused | Likely yes |
| Ketosis maintenance | Yes |

## Medical Fasts: Be Careful

### Pre-Surgery

**Avoid CBD Because:**
- Drug interactions
- Anaesthesia concerns
- Bleeding considerations
- Not just about eating

### Blood Tests

**May Affect:**
- Liver enzyme readings
- Some metabolic markers
- Follow doctor's instructions
- Disclose CBD use

### When in Doubt

If a medical professional tells you to fast, ask specifically about CBD.

## Intermittent Fasting Compatibility

### Why It Usually Works

**CBD Doesn't:**
- Spike insulin
- Trigger digestion significantly
- Break ketosis
- Interfere with autophagy (likely)

### Optimal Approach

- Use pure CBD oil
- Avoid CBD gummies (sugar)
- Avoid CBD capsules with additives
- Take sublingual for minimal GI effect

## Religious Fasting Considerations

### Varies by Tradition

**Questions to Consider:**

- Consult religious authority
- Personal interpretation matters

### Not a Religious Ruling

## Best Practices

### If You Choose to Use CBD While Fasting

1. **Pure oil sublingually** — Minimal digestive involvement
2. **Avoid caloric products** — No gummies, chocolates
3. **Small amounts** — Less carrier oil
4. **Consistent timing** — Know how it affects you

### If Uncertain

Simply take CBD during your eating window—it will still work.

## My Take

For most intermittent fasting protocols, pure CBD oil is unlikely to meaningfully break your fast. The minimal calories in carrier oil don't typically trigger insulin or interrupt autophagy. However, for medical fasts, always follow your healthcare provider's instructions and disclose CBD use. For religious fasting, consult appropriate authorities. When in doubt, simply move CBD to your eating window.
