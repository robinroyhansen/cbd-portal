## Key Takeaways

2. **Doesn't impair** playing ability
3. **Physical benefits** for repetitive strain
4. **Test in rehearsal** before performances
5. **Low-moderate doses** for focus

## My Take

Music and CBD combine well. Performance anxiety is something most musicians deal with, and CBD can help without the impairment of alcohol or the side effects of prescription options.

The physical applications matter too. Musicians put their bodies through repetitive motions that create strain. CBD's anti-inflammatory properties support the physical demands of playing.
