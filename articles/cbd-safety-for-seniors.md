## Quick Summary

CBD can be appropriate for seniors, but requires extra caution due to age-related changes in metabolism, increased medication use, and heightened sensitivity to side effects. Older adults should start with lower doses than guidelines suggest, work closely with healthcare providers, and be especially vigilant about drug interactions. Many seniors use CBD safely and beneficially when approached carefully.

## Key Takeaways

- Extra caution needed for seniors
- Metabolism slows with age
- Medication interactions a major concern
- Start with lower doses
- Healthcare provider consultation essential

---

## Why Seniors Need Special Consideration

### Age-Related Changes

**Physiological Differences:**
- Slower metabolism
- Reduced liver function
- Changed body composition
- Altered drug distribution

**Practical Impact:**
- CBD processed more slowly
- Effects may be stronger
- Duration may be longer
- Standard doses may be too high

---

## Metabolism Considerations

### Liver Function

**With Age:**
- Liver metabolises drugs slower
- CBD primarily processed by liver
- Same dose = higher blood levels
- Effects last longer

### What This Means

**For Seniors:**
- Lower doses often effective
- Start much lower than standard
- "Start low, go very slow"
- Monitor carefully

---

## Medication Interactions

### The Primary Concern

**Seniors Often Take:**
- Multiple medications
- Long-term prescriptions
- Drugs with narrow therapeutic windows
- Medications affected by CYP450 enzymes

### High-Risk Medications

**Common in Seniors:**

**Blood Thinners:**
- Warfarin (significant interaction)
- CBD increases warfarin levels
- Bleeding risk increases
- Requires INR monitoring

**Heart Medications:**
- Blood pressure drugs
- Anti-arrhythmics
- Statins
- All may interact

**Other Common Medications:**
- Pain medications
- Sleep aids
- Antidepressants
- Diabetes medications

## Starting CBD as a Senior

### Recommended Approach

**Step-by-Step:**
1. Consult healthcare provider first
2. List ALL medications
3. Check each for interactions
4. Start at 5-10mg (half normal starting dose)
5. Increase very slowly (weekly, not daily)
6. Monitor closely

### Dosing Guidelines

| Age Group | Starting Dose | Increase Rate |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Under 60 | 10-20mg | Every few days |
| 60-75 | 5-10mg | Weekly |
| Over 75 | 5mg | Every 1-2 weeks |

## My Take

CBD can be safe and beneficial for seniors, but the approach must be more cautious than for younger adults. The key concerns are medication interactions and altered metabolism. Work with your healthcare provider, start at half the normal starting dose (5mg vs. 10mg), and increase more slowly. Monitor for side effects, especially falls, confusion, and blood pressure changes. Many seniors use CBD successfully—but those who do best take a careful, supervised approach.
