## Key Takeaways

1. **Low doses** during work to maintain focus
2. **Transition ritual** to end workday
3. **Evening use** for unwinding and sleep
4. **Part of routine** that replaces commute
5. **Address ergonomics** separately

## My Take

Remote work has changed how many of us experience stress and boundaries. CBD can be a useful tool for establishing routines—a morning dose to start work, an evening dose to signal it's done.

The transition piece is key. Without a commute, remote workers often struggle to mentally leave work. A ritual that includes CBD can help establish that boundary.
