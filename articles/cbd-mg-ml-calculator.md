## Quick Summary

To calculate CBD per ml, divide the total mg in the bottle by the bottle size in ml. For a 1000mg CBD in a 30ml bottle: 1000 ÷ 30 = 33.3mg per ml. Knowing this helps you measure accurate doses using the dropper. Most droppers hold approximately 1ml (one full dropper).

---

## Key Takeaways

- CBD per ml = Total mg ÷ Bottle size (ml)
- One full dropper ≈ 1ml
- One drop ≈ 0.05ml (20 drops per ml)
- Measure by dropper, not by drops
- Calculate once, reference always

---

## The Basic Formula

### Calculate mg per ml

**Formula:**
```
CBD per ml = Total CBD (mg) ÷ Bottle size (ml)
```

**Example:**
- 1000mg CBD in 30ml bottle
- 1000 ÷ 30 = 33.3mg per ml
- One full dropper ≈ 33.3mg CBD

## Common Bottle Calculations

### 10ml Bottles

| Total CBD | mg per ml | Per Full Dropper |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| 250mg | 25mg/ml | ~25mg |
| 500mg | 50mg/ml | ~50mg |
| 1000mg | 100mg/ml | ~100mg |

### 30ml Bottles

| Total CBD | mg per ml | Per Full Dropper |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| 250mg | 8.3mg/ml | ~8mg |
| 500mg | 16.7mg/ml | ~17mg |
| 1000mg | 33.3mg/ml | ~33mg |
| 1500mg | 50mg/ml | ~50mg |
| 2000mg | 66.7mg/ml | ~67mg |
| 3000mg | 100mg/ml | ~100mg |

## Understanding Droppers

### Full Dropper = 1ml

**Standard Droppers:**
- One full squeeze = approximately 1ml
- Fill line shows 1ml
- May be graduated with markings

**Half Dropper:**
- Approximately 0.5ml
- Half the mg per ml value

### Drop Calculations

**Approximately:**
- 20 drops = 1ml
- 1 drop ≈ 0.05ml

**To Calculate Per Drop:**
```
CBD per drop = mg per ml ÷ 20
```

**Example:**
- 33.3mg per ml ÷ 20 = 1.67mg per drop

## Step-by-Step Calculation

### Find Your CBD Per ml

**Step 1:** Find total CBD on label
- Look for "Total CBD: Xmg"
- Usually on front of bottle

**Step 2:** Find bottle size
- Usually 10ml or 30ml
- Check label or bottle

**Step 3:** Calculate
- Divide total CBD by ml
- This is your mg per ml

**Step 4:** Determine your dose
- Full dropper = mg per ml
- Half dropper = half that
- Quarter dropper = quarter that

---

## Dose Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Low Dose

**Want:** 10mg CBD
**Have:** 500mg in 30ml (16.7mg/ml)
**Calculate:** 10 ÷ 16.7 = 0.6ml
**Measure:** Just over half a dropper

### Example 2: Medium Dose

**Want:** 25mg CBD
**Have:** 1000mg in 30ml (33.3mg/ml)
**Calculate:** 25 ÷ 33.3 = 0.75ml
**Measure:** About three-quarters of a dropper

### Example 3: Higher Dose

**Want:** 50mg CBD
**Have:** 1500mg in 30ml (50mg/ml)
**Calculate:** 50 ÷ 50 = 1ml
**Measure:** One full dropper

## Quick Reference Chart

### How Much to Take for Common Doses

**If Your Bottle Is 1000mg/30ml (33.3mg/ml):**

| Desired Dose | Amount to Take |
|--------------|----------------|
| 10mg | 1/3 dropper |
| 15mg | 1/2 dropper |
| 20mg | 2/3 dropper |
| 25mg | 3/4 dropper |
| 33mg | Full dropper |

**If Your Bottle Is 500mg/30ml (16.7mg/ml):**

| Desired Dose | Amount to Take |
|--------------|----------------|
| 8mg | 1/2 dropper |
| 10mg | 2/3 dropper |
| 15mg | Full dropper |
| 20mg | 1.25 droppers |
| 25mg | 1.5 droppers |

## Measuring Tips

### For Accuracy

**Best Practices:**
- Use dropper consistently
- Full squeeze to fill
- Hold vertically when measuring
- Use same technique each time

**Visual Guide:**
- Full = 1ml
- Three-quarter = 0.75ml
- Half = 0.5ml
- Quarter = 0.25ml

### Graduated Droppers

Some droppers have markings:
- 0.25ml
- 0.5ml
- 0.75ml
- 1.0ml

Use these for precise dosing.

## Converting Percentages to mg

### Understanding % Labels

Some products show CBD as percentage.

**Formula:**
```
mg per ml = % × 10
```

**Examples:**
- 5% CBD = 50mg per ml
- 10% CBD = 100mg per ml
- 15% CBD = 150mg per ml
- 20% CBD = 200mg per ml

### Why This Works

Percentage = grams per 100ml
1g = 1000mg
So 5% = 5g per 100ml = 50mg per ml

---

## Creating Your Reference Card

### Personal Calculation Sheet

Fill in for your product:

```
My CBD Oil:
- Brand: ____________
- Total CBD: ____mg
- Bottle size: ____ml
- CBD per ml: ____mg
- CBD per drop: ____mg

My Doses:
- Full dropper: ____mg
- Half dropper: ____mg
- Quarter dropper: ____mg
```

Keep this with your CBD for easy reference.

## Common Calculation Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Using Total, Not Per Serving

**Wrong:** "My bottle is 1000mg, so I took 1000mg"
**Right:** Calculate mg per ml, then measure dose

### Mistake 2: Assuming All Bottles Same

**Wrong:** "One dropper is always 30mg"
**Right:** Depends on your specific product's concentration

### Mistake 3: Counting Drops Inconsistently

**Wrong:** Varying drop sizes
**Right:** Use dropper measurements, not drop counting

### Mistake 4: Forgetting Bottle Size Differences

**Wrong:** 1000mg in 10ml = 1000mg in 30ml
**Right:**
- 1000mg/10ml = 100mg/ml
- 1000mg/30ml = 33mg/ml

---

## When Drops Matter

### If Counting Drops

**Use Consistent Technique:**
- Same angle
- Same pressure
- Same temperature
- Same dropper

**Average Drop Size:**
- Approximately 0.05ml
- About 20 drops per ml
- Varies by oil viscosity

---

## My Take

The math isn't hard, but it's crucial. Do this calculation once when you get a new product, write it down, and reference it. Knowing exactly how much CBD you're taking is essential for finding your optimal dose and not wasting product. Most confusion comes from not understanding the difference between total CBD in the bottle and CBD per serving. Once you understand mg per ml, dosing becomes simple.
