## My Take

In-store shopping makes sense when you want something today, prefer to see products before buying, or value personal interaction. But be realistic: selection will be limited, prices will be higher, and staff knowledge varies widely. Do your research beforehand, know what you're looking for, and don't be afraid to walk away if something seems off. For ongoing CBD purchases, online usually offers better value—but in-store can be great for trying something new or in a pinch.
