## Both Morning and Night

### Split Dosing

Who benefits:

## Dose-Dependent Effects

### The Pattern

Understanding:
- Lower doses: more alerting/focusing
- Higher doses: more sedating/relaxing
- This influences timing choice
- Individual variation exists

### Finding Your Sweet Spot

Experiment:

- Note effects on energy/focus
- Try evening dose, note sleep

## Based on Your Goals

### For Anxiety

Approach:

- Timing matches when needed

### For Pain

Consider:
- Morning for day functionality
- Evening for sleep disruption from pain
- Both for chronic conditions
- Time to when pain is worst

### For Sleep

Clear choice:
- Evening/nighttime
- 1-2 hours before bed
- Higher dose acceptable
- Consistency helps

### For General Wellness

Flexible:

## Key Takeaways

1. **Morning** for daytime symptoms and focus
2. **Evening** for sleep and relaxation
3. **Both** for all-day coverage
4. **Dose affects** alerting vs sedating
5. **Consistency** matters more than perfect timing

## My Take

There's no universally "best" time to take CBD—it depends entirely on what you're trying to achieve. For sleep issues, evening is obvious. For daytime anxiety, morning makes sense. For chronic pain, you might need both.

The most important thing is consistency. Taking CBD at the same time each day, whatever time that is, helps establish steady levels and predictable effects.
