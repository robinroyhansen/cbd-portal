## Cost Comparison

### Per MG Cost

Generally:

- Budget-friendly option

### Effectiveness Cost

But consider:

## Key Takeaways

1. **99%+ pure** CBD, nothing else
2. **Zero THC** guaranteed
3. **Drug test safe**
4. **May need** higher doses
5. **Good for** specific needs

---

## My Take

CBD isolate is perfect for specific situations—drug testing, THC avoidance, precise dosing needs. It's pure, clean, and predictable.

But for general wellness use, full-spectrum or broad-spectrum may be more effective per dollar. Isolate works, but you may need more to achieve the same results. Choose based on your specific needs, not just the "purity" marketing.
