## Quick Answer

CBD is **legal in Germany** when derived from EU-approved hemp varieties and containing less than 0.2% THC. However, CBD products sold as food or supplements must comply with EU Novel Food regulations. Germany has one of Europe's most developed CBD markets, but regulatory enforcement can vary by region.

## Legal Status Overview

### What's Legal

- CBD products from EU-approved hemp varieties
- Products with THC content below 0.2%
- Cosmetic CBD products (clearly labeled)
- CBD flowers from licensed hemp (with restrictions)
- Epidiolex (prescription medication)

### What's Restricted or Complex

- CBD as food/supplements (Novel Food issues)
- CBD flowers (grey area, regional variation)
- Marketing health claims
- THC above 0.2% (controlled substance)

---

## The Novel Food Situation

### EU Novel Food Regulation

Since January 2019, CBD extracts are classified as Novel Food under EU regulation. This means:

- CBD food products require Novel Food authorization
- Applications are pending but none approved yet
- Enforcement varies by German state (Bundesland)
- Many products remain on sale during transition

### Current Reality

Despite Novel Food requirements:
- Thousands of CBD products are sold in Germany
- Major retailers stock CBD
- Pharmacies sell CBD products
- Online shops operate openly

Authorities have generally not conducted mass seizures while Novel Food applications are processed.

---

## THC Limits

### The 0.2% Rule

Germany follows EU hemp regulations:
- Hemp must contain ≤0.2% THC
- Products derived from such hemp should maintain this limit
- Some finished products aim for "THC-free" (non-detectable)

### Why This Matters

Products exceeding 0.2% THC:
- May be classified as narcotics
- Could result in seizure
- Sellers may face legal consequences

Always verify THC content through third-party lab reports.
