## Quick Summary

Store CBD products in a cool, dark, dry place away from heat, light, and humidity. Most CBD products last 1-2 years when stored properly. Keep bottles sealed when not in use, avoid bathroom storage (humidity), and don't leave products in hot cars. Proper storage preserves potency and extends shelf life.

- Can promote bacterial growth

**Oxygen:**
- Oxidises cannabinoids
- Reduces potency over time
- Keep sealed when not in use

**Humidity:**
- Can introduce moisture
- May cause mould
- Affects product integrity

## My Take

Proper storage is easy and makes a real difference. A cabinet in a climate-controlled room handles most needs—just keep products cool, dark, and sealed. The most common mistake I see is bathroom storage, which combines humidity and temperature fluctuations, both enemies of CBD preservation. Treat your CBD like you'd treat a quality cooking oil: cool, dark, sealed, and used within a reasonable timeframe.
