## Terpineol and the Pinene Connection

Terpineol is often found alongside pinene because:
- Can be created from pinene chemically
- Co-occurs in similar plant profiles

When a CBD product feels particularly relaxing beyond what the CBD content suggests, terpineol is often present. For evening use or sleep applications, I value products with meaningful terpineol content. The pleasant floral aroma is a bonus that makes products genuinely enjoyable to use.
