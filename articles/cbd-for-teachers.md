## Professional Considerations

Know your district:
- Some schools drug test
- Others don't
- Policy varies widely
- Research before using

### If Drug Tested

Essential:

## Practical Use for Teachers

### For Stress

Approach:
- Morning dose before school
- Evening dose for decompression
- Consistent use for best results
- Low doses maintain alertness

## What CBD Won't Do

### Limitations

Be realistic:
- Won't solve workload issues
- Doesn't fix systemic problems
- Not a substitute for boundaries
- Supportive, not solution

### Burnout Needs More

If seriously burned out:
- CBD is band-aid
- Consider bigger changes
- Professional support helpful
- Self-care essential

## Key Takeaways

1. **Many teachers use CBD** for stress and sleep
2. **Know your school's policy** on drug testing
3. **Use THC-free if tested**
4. **Don't use during school**
5. **Address root causes** of stress too

## My Take

Teachers face incredible stress, and CBD can be a reasonable part of a wellness routine. The key is knowing your school's policies—if they drug test, stick to verified THC-free products.

Use CBD to support your well-being, but also address the systemic issues of the profession. CBD helps manage stress; it doesn't fix unsustainable workloads or poor administrative support.
