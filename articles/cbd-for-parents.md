## Key Takeaways

## My Take

Parents deal with incredible demands, and many don't prioritize their own wellness. CBD can be part of a self-care routine that helps you be a better, more patient parent.

The non-impairing nature is key—you can use CBD and still be fully present for your children, respond to their needs, and make good judgments. It's very different from alcohol or anything that dulls your parenting capacity.
