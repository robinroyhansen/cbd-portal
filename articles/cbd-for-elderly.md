Seniors often have the most to gain from CBD—chronic pain, sleep issues, and anxiety are common in this age group, and CBD offers a non-addictive option. But the drug interaction issue is real and must be taken seriously.

Don't start CBD without talking to your doctor, especially if you take multiple medications. With proper guidance, CBD can be a valuable addition to an older adult's wellness approach.
