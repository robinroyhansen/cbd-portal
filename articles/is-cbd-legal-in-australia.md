## Quick Answer

CBD became available over-the-counter in Australia in 2021, but with **significant restrictions**. Low-dose CBD (≤150mg/day) can be purchased from pharmacies without prescription, but products must be TGA-approved. In practice, availability remains limited and more restrictive than the US or Europe.

---

## Australia's Regulatory Framework

### The 2021 Change

Australia's TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) rescheduled low-dose CBD:
- CBD up to 150mg/day moved to Schedule 3
- Schedule 3 = pharmacy-only (no prescription needed)
- Products must be TGA-approved
- Higher doses still require prescription

### What This Means

In theory:
- Low-dose CBD available at pharmacies
- No prescription needed

In practice:
- Very few TGA-approved OTC products
- Limited availability
- Higher doses need prescription
- More restrictive than other developed countries

## How to Get CBD in Australia

### Option 1: Pharmacy (OTC)

For Schedule 3 CBD (≤150mg/day):
- Available at pharmacies
- No prescription needed
- Must be TGA-approved product
- Pharmacist consultation required
- Very limited product options

### Option 2: Prescription (Higher Doses)

For higher doses or specific conditions:
- See a doctor
- Get prescription for Schedule 4 CBD
- Access through pharmacies
- More products available
- For therapeutic purposes

### Option 3: Special Access Scheme

For unapproved products:
- Doctor applies on your behalf
- For products not TGA-registered

## The Availability Problem

### Why It's Limited

Despite 2021 changes:
- Few manufacturers have sought TGA approval
- Approval process is expensive/complex

### Practical Reality

- Prescription route is more common
- OTC options very limited
- Online imports mostly illegal
- Market underdeveloped compared to US/Europe

## Key Takeaways

1. **Low-dose CBD is OTC** in theory (≤150mg/day)
2. **Availability is limited** — few approved products
3. **Prescription route** is more practical for many
4. **Cannot import** CBD products (usually)
5. **TGA regulation** ensures quality

## My Take

Australia's CBD situation is frustrating for consumers. The 2021 change to allow low-dose OTC CBD was progressive in intent, but the reality is very limited availability. Few companies have gone through TGA approval, leaving Australians with fewer options than many other developed countries.

The practical advice for Australians:
- For low-dose needs, check what's available at pharmacies
- For higher doses or better options, talk to a doctor about prescription CBD
- Telehealth clinics have made prescription access easier
- Don't try to import products—it's not worth the risk

The system is more regulated but also more limiting. The prescription pathway, while more complex, actually provides better product access for those who need it.
