## Key Takeaways

1. **Subscriptions work** for consistent, daily users
2. **Discounts should be** significant (15%+)
3. **Cancellation should be** easy and free
4. **Review regularly** to ensure value
5. **Not ideal** for those still experimenting

---

## My Take

CBD subscriptions make sense if you've found your product and use it consistently. The convenience and savings are real. But don't subscribe until you've experimented enough to know what works for you—you'll just end up with unused product.

Always verify easy cancellation before subscribing. A good company makes it simple to cancel or pause. If they make it difficult, that's a red flag about their business practices generally.
