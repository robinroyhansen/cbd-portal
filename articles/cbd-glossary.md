---

## A

### Anandamide
An endocannabinoid produced naturally by the body. Often called the "bliss molecule." CBD may increase anandamide levels by inhibiting its breakdown.

### Anxiolytic
Anxiety-reducing. CBD has anxiolytic properties, meaning it may help reduce anxiety.

---

## B

### Bioavailability
The percentage of CBD that actually reaches your bloodstream after consumption. Varies by delivery method: sublingual ~20-35%, oral ~10-20%, inhaled ~30-50%.

### Broad-Spectrum
CBD extract containing multiple cannabinoids and terpenes but with THC removed. Good for those who want some entourage effect without THC.

---

## C

### Cannabidiol (CBD)
The main non-intoxicating cannabinoid in hemp. Does not produce a high. Primary compound in CBD products.

### Cannabinoid
Chemical compounds found in cannabis plants (phytocannabinoids) or produced by the body (endocannabinoids). CBD, THC, CBG, and CBN are cannabinoids.

### Cannabinol (CBN)
A cannabinoid formed when THC degrades. Often marketed for sleep, though evidence is limited.

### Cannabigerol (CBG)
Known as the "mother cannabinoid" because other cannabinoids are synthesized from it. Found in small amounts in mature cannabis.

### Carrier Oil
The oil CBD is dissolved in for products. Common carriers include MCT oil, hemp seed oil, and olive oil. Affects absorption and taste.

### Certificate of Analysis (COA)
Lab report showing a product's cannabinoid content and testing for contaminants. Essential for verifying product quality.

### CO2 Extraction
A clean extraction method using pressurized carbon dioxide. Considered the gold standard for CBD extraction.

### CYP450 Enzymes
Liver enzymes that metabolize many drugs and CBD. CBD can inhibit these enzymes, causing drug interactions.

---

## D

### Delta-9 THC
The primary psychoactive compound in cannabis. Hemp must contain ≤0.3% Delta-9 THC (US) or ≤0.2% (EU) to be legal.

### Dose/Dosage
The amount of CBD taken. Typically measured in milligrams (mg). Common doses range from 10-100mg depending on purpose.

---

## E

### Endocannabinoid
Cannabinoids produced naturally by the human body. Include anandamide and 2-AG. Part of the endocannabinoid system.

### Endocannabinoid System (ECS)
A biological system in humans and mammals consisting of endocannabinoids, receptors (CB1, CB2), and enzymes. Regulates many bodily functions.

### Entourage Effect
The theory that cannabis compounds work better together than in isolation. Cannabinoids and terpenes may have synergistic effects.

### Extraction
The process of separating CBD and other compounds from plant material. Methods include CO2, ethanol, and hydrocarbon extraction.

---

## F

### Farm Bill (2018)
US legislation that legalized hemp (≤0.3% THC) and hemp-derived products like CBD at the federal level.

### First-Pass Metabolism
When CBD passes through the digestive system and liver before reaching general circulation, reducing bioavailability. Sublingual bypasses this.

### Full-Spectrum
CBD extract containing all cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds from the hemp plant, including trace THC (≤0.3%).

---

## G

### Gummies
Edible CBD products in gummy candy form. Popular for taste and convenience. Typically contain pre-measured doses.

---

## H

### Half-Life
The time it takes for half the CBD in your system to be eliminated. CBD's half-life is roughly 2-5 days, depending on frequency of use.

### Hemp
Cannabis sativa plants containing ≤0.3% THC (US) or ≤0.2% THC (EU). Legal source of CBD products. Same species as marijuana but different THC content.

### Hemp Seed Oil
Oil pressed from hemp seeds. Contains no cannabinoids. Nutritious but not the same as CBD oil. Often confused with CBD oil.

---

## I

### Isolate
Pure CBD (99%+) with all other cannabinoids and terpenes removed. No THC. No entourage effect.

---

## M

### MCT Oil
Medium-chain triglyceride oil, often from coconut. Common carrier oil for CBD products. May enhance absorption.

### mg (Milligram)
Unit of measurement for CBD dosing. Products list total mg in container and sometimes mg per serving.

---

## N

### Nanoemulsion
Technology that creates very small CBD particles for potentially improved absorption. Used in "water-soluble" CBD products. Claims sometimes exaggerated.

### Novel Food
EU regulatory classification for foods without significant history of consumption before 1997. CBD products in EU subject to Novel Food approval process.

---

## O

### Onset
How long it takes to feel CBD's effects. Varies by method: sublingual 15-30 min, oral 30-90 min, inhaled 5-10 min.

---

## P

### Phytocannabinoid
Cannabinoids produced by plants, primarily cannabis. Includes CBD, THC, CBG, CBN, and over 100 others.

---

## S

### Sublingual
Administration under the tongue. CBD oil held under tongue for 60-90 seconds absorbs through mucous membranes, bypassing first-pass metabolism.

---

## T

### Terpenes
Aromatic compounds in cannabis and other plants responsible for smell and potentially therapeutic effects. Examples: myrcene, limonene, linalool.

### THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol)
The primary psychoactive cannabinoid in cannabis. Produces the "high." Hemp-derived CBD products contain ≤0.3% THC (US).

### Tincture
CBD dissolved in alcohol or oil. Often used interchangeably with "CBD oil." Taken sublingually.

### Titration
The process of finding your optimal CBD dose by starting low and gradually increasing.

### Topical
CBD products applied to the skin (creams, balms, lotions). Work locally without entering general bloodstream.

---

## W

### Water-Soluble CBD
CBD processed to mix with water. Often uses nanoemulsion technology. May have improved absorption, though claims vary.
