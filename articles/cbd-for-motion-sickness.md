## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD's anti-nausea** effects may help
2. **Take before travel**, not after symptoms start
3. **Combine with** other prevention strategies
4. **May not be enough** for severe motion sickness
5. **Natural alternative** to traditional medications

## My Take

Motion sickness is miserable, and anything that helps without significant side effects is valuable. CBD's anti-nausea properties may provide relief, and unlike many motion sickness medications, it typically doesn't cause drowsiness.

But CBD probably won't work alone for severe motion sickness. Use it as part of a comprehensive approach—good positioning, looking at the horizon, avoiding triggers, and possibly combining with other remedies. The goal is comfortable travel, whatever combination of strategies achieves that.
