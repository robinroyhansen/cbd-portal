## My Take

Martial arts training is uniquely demanding—the combination of high-impact striking and joint-stressing grappling creates significant recovery needs. CBD fits well into a martial artist's toolkit, supporting recovery from the inherent physical stress of combat sports.

For competitive martial artists, product purity is non-negotiable. Most organizations prohibit THC, so use verified products only.
