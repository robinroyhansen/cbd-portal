## Key Takeaways

- FDA approved in 2018 for rare epilepsies
- Reduced seizures by 40-50% in trials
- Demonstrates CBD can meet pharmaceutical standards
- Uses pharmaceutical-grade CBD (99%+ pure)
- High doses: 10-25 mg/kg/day

---

## The Clinical Trials

### Study Design

Rigorous methodology:
- Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
- Large sample sizes (hundreds of patients)
- Multiple independent studies
- Published in top medical journals

### Conditions Studied

Approved for:
- Dravet syndrome
- Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
- Tuberous sclerosis complex

### Results

Consistently impressive:
- 40-50% reduction in seizure frequency
- Significant vs placebo
- Improvements in quality of life
- Results replicated across trials

## What It Means

### For CBD Science

Epidiolex demonstrates:
- CBD has real medical efficacy
- Can pass pharmaceutical scrutiny
- Mechanisms are scientific, not placebo
- Research can overcome regulatory barriers

### For Consumers

However, note:
- Different from consumer CBD products
- Pharmaceutical-grade purity
- Much higher doses than typical use
- Different formulation

---

## Limitations

Important context:
- Approved for epilepsy only
- Not evidence for other conditions
- Doses far exceed consumer products
- Significant side effects at these doses

---

## My Take

Epidiolex is the best evidence that CBD has real medical effects. When sceptics say CBD is "just placebo," point them to these trials. However, I don't extrapolate this to claim consumer CBD products work the same way—the doses and applications are different. Epidiolex proves CBD's potential; it doesn't validate all CBD marketing claims.
