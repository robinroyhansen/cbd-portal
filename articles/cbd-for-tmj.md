## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD may help** through relaxation and anti-inflammatory effects
2. **Topical to jaw area** for local relief
3. **Oral addresses** stress/anxiety component
4. **Night guard often essential**
5. **Stress management** is key

## My Take

TMJ often has a significant stress component—many people clench their jaws without realizing it. CBD can help here both through direct muscle relaxation and by addressing underlying anxiety.

For TMJ relief, I'd suggest both topical application to the jaw area and oral CBD for overall relaxation and stress management. But if you grind your teeth at night, a night guard is probably still necessary—CBD helps but may not fully prevent bruxism.
