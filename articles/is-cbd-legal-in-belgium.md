## My Take

Belgium offers a solid CBD market, particularly in Brussels. The country's central European location means you're well-served by both domestic products and EU imports.

For those in Belgium, CBD is accessible without significant barriers. Brussels has multiple specialist shops, and quality online options serve the whole country.

One consideration: if you're traveling to the Netherlands, be aware that their 0.05% THC limit is much stricter than Belgium's 0.2%. Products legal in Belgium may not be compliant across that border.
