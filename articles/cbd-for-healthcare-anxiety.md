## Key Takeaways

1. **Healthcare anxiety is common** and affects care
2. **CBD may help** manage appointment anxiety
3. **Time before appointments** (30-60 minutes)
4. **Test beforehand** — know your response
5. **Disclose to providers** when relevant

---

## My Take

Healthcare anxiety keeps people from getting care they need. If CBD helps someone get through a dental cleaning or necessary medical appointment, that's a meaningful benefit.

The key is having your approach dialed in before important appointments. Test CBD at home first, know your optimal dose, and time it so effects have onset before you arrive.
