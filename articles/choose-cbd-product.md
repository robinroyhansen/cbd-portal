## Quick Summary

Choosing the right CBD product depends on your goals, preferences, and lifestyle. Consider what you want CBD for (sleep, discomfort, general wellness), how quickly you need effects, your comfort with different consumption methods, and your budget. There's no single "best" product—the right choice is personal.

## Key Takeaways

- Match product to your goals
- Consider speed of effects needed
- Think about convenience and lifestyle
- Start simple, adjust later
- Quality matters more than format

## Step 1: Define Your Goal

### What Are You Using CBD For?

**General Wellness:**
- Daily maintenance
- Overall balance
- Preventative use
- Oil or capsules work well

**Specific Concerns:**
- Sleep → Consider evening formats
- Localised discomfort → Topicals
- Fast-acting needs → Sublingual or inhaled
- Long-lasting → Edibles or capsules

## Step 2: Choose Your Spectrum

### Three Options

| Type | Contains | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| Full-spectrum | All cannabinoids including trace THC | Maximum entourage effect |
| Broad-spectrum | Multiple cannabinoids, no THC | Entourage effect without THC |
| Isolate | Pure CBD only | THC sensitivity, drug testing concerns |

### Which to Choose?

**Full-spectrum if:**
- No drug testing concerns
- Want maximum effect
- Okay with trace THC

**Broad-spectrum if:**
- Want multiple cannabinoids
- Prefer zero THC
- Balance of effect and safety

**Isolate if:**
- Subject to drug testing
- THC-sensitive
- Want precise CBD dosing

## Step 4: Determine Strength

### Starting Recommendations

| Experienced | Higher (1000mg+) |

### Calculate Your Needs

- Estimate daily dose (start 10-25mg)
- Multiply by days bottle should last
- Choose appropriate strength
- Higher strength = better value per mg

---

## Step 5: Set Your Budget

### Cost Considerations

**Per-mg Cost:**
- Budget: £0.05-0.08/mg

### Value Tips

## Decision Framework

### Quick Guide

**If you want...**

| Goal | Recommended Start |
|------|-------------------|
| Try CBD first time | Low-strength oil or gummies |
| Daily wellness | Medium-strength capsules or oil |
| Sleep support | Full-spectrum oil, evening use |
| Localised relief | Topical cream or balm |
| Fast relief | Sublingual oil (or vape with caution) |
| Convenience | Capsules or gummies |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't

- Buy based on price alone
- Ignore third-party testing
- Start with highest strength
- Choose format you won't use
- Skip research on brand

### Do

- Prioritise quality
- Start low, go slow
- Choose realistic format
- Read lab reports
- Give it time to work

---

## Adjusting Over Time

### It's Okay to Change

**You might:**
- Switch formats after trying
- Adjust strength up or down
- Try different spectrum types
- Change brands

### Normal Progression

Many people start with one product type and evolve their approach as they learn what works.

---

## My Take

Don't overthink your first CBD purchase. Start with a quality full-spectrum oil in a moderate strength from a reputable brand. It's versatile, cost-effective, and lets you find your dose. Once you know CBD works for you and understand your dosing needs, then experiment with other formats. The "best" product is the one you'll actually use consistently.
