## How Microdosing Works

### Consistent Levels

Theory:
- Maintain steady CBD levels
- Avoid peaks and valleys
- Ongoing endocannabinoid support
- Subtle regulation

### Biphasic Response

CBD characteristic:
- Low doses may be stimulating
- High doses more sedating
- Microdosing stays in lower range
- Different effect profile

## How to Microdose CBD

### Starting Protocol

Approach:
- Begin with 2-5mg per dose
- Take 2-3 times daily
- Maintain for 1-2 weeks
- Evaluate effects

### Timing

Schedule:
- Morning dose
- Early afternoon dose
- Evening dose (optional or higher)
- Consistent timing

### Product Selection

Best for microdosing:
- Tinctures (precise dosing)
- Low-dose gummies
- CBD water/beverages
- Avoid high-dose products

---

## Calculating Microdoses

### With Tinctures

Math:
- Know mg per dropper
- 1000mg/30ml = ~33mg per full dropper
- Quarter dropper = ~8mg
- Adjust based on your product

### With Gummies

Options:
- Cut larger gummies
- Buy low-dose (5-10mg) gummies
- Consistent portions
- Less precision than tincture

---

## When Microdosing Makes Sense

### Good Fit

Consider if:
- Mild symptoms
- Sensitivity to substances
- Need to stay sharp
- Budget limited
- Exploring CBD

### Not Ideal

May not work if:
- Moderate-severe symptoms
- Need stronger relief
- Have tried standard dosing successfully
- Want faster results

## Comparing Approaches

### Microdosing vs Standard Dosing

| Factor | Microdosing | Standard |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Dose | 2-10mg | 25-50mg+ |
| Frequency | Multiple daily | 1-2x daily |
| Effects | Subtle | More noticeable |
| Alertness | Maintained | May cause drowsiness |
| Cost | Lower per day | Higher per day |

---

## Adjusting Your Approach

### If Not Enough

Try:
- Increase dose slightly
- Add another daily dose
- Consider standard dosing
- Give more time

### If Too Much

Adjust:
- Lower each dose
- Reduce frequency
- You're finding your threshold
- Sensitivity identified

## Key Takeaways

1. **Very small doses** (2-10mg) multiple times daily
2. **Subtle effects** maintained throughout day
3. **Good for sensitive** individuals
4. **May not be enough** for significant symptoms
5. **Tinctures best** for precise dosing

## My Take

Microdosing CBD is worth trying for mild symptoms or if you're sensitive to substances. The subtle, consistent support may be all some people need, and it maintains alertness throughout the day.

But be realistic—microdosing may not provide enough relief for moderate symptoms. If microdosing doesn't help after a couple weeks, you might just need standard doses. It's a valid approach, not a universally better one.
