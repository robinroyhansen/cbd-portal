## Key Takeaways

1. **No COA** is the biggest red flag
2. **Health claims** are illegal and suspicious
3. **Too cheap** usually means poor quality
4. **Vague labeling** hides poor products
5. **Trust your instincts** about sketchy products

## My Take

The CBD market has genuine quality products and complete junk. The difference often isn't obvious from packaging alone. The single most important factor is third-party testing—if a company won't provide a current, relevant COA, don't buy from them.

A good rule: if something seems too good to be true (price, claims, etc.), it probably is. Quality CBD costs money to produce, test, and sell properly. Companies that cut corners on testing probably cut corners elsewhere too.
