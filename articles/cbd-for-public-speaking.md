## My Take

Public speaking anxiety is one of the most compelling use cases for CBD. The research actually studied CBD in simulated public speaking situations and found meaningful anxiety reduction.

The key is finding your optimal dose—enough to calm nerves but not so much that you feel sluggish. For most people, this is in the 15-30mg range taken about 45 minutes before speaking.

Most importantly: never use CBD for the first time before an important presentation. Test it in lower-stakes situations first. Know exactly how it affects your speaking, your energy, and your mental clarity. Then, when you have a big presentation, you can use it confidently.
