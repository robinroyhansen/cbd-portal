## Key Takeaways

1. **Nerve pain is complex** — CBD may help some people
2. **Research is promising** but still developing
3. **Higher doses often needed** compared to other uses
4. **Oral + topical** combination may work best
5. **Work with healthcare provider** for proper diagnosis
6. **Patience required** — weeks to assess effect

## My Take

Nerve pain is one of the more challenging conditions where CBD might help. The mechanisms make sense, and many people report meaningful relief. However, neuropathic pain often requires higher CBD doses and more patience than other applications.

What's important: get proper diagnosis of your nerve pain and work with healthcare providers. CBD can be part of a comprehensive approach but shouldn't replace medical evaluation and treatment of underlying causes.
