## My Take

One of CBD's genuine advantages is that you're not trapped. Unlike many medications or substances, you can stop CBD without withdrawal, tapering, or medical supervision. If you want to see what life is like without it, just stop.

What you may notice is the return of whatever symptoms CBD was managing. That's not CBD withdrawal—that's your original issue. It's useful information: if symptoms return, you know CBD was helping. If nothing changes, maybe you didn't need it.
