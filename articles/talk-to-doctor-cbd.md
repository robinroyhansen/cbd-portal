## My Take

I always recommend talking to your doctor before starting CBD, especially if you take any medications. Yes, some doctors are uninformed or dismissive—but medication interactions are real and potentially serious. If your doctor won't engage meaningfully, find one who will. The conversation doesn't have to be long—a simple discussion about your medications and safety considerations is often enough. Your health is worth a potentially awkward conversation.
