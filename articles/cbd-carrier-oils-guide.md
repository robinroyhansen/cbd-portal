## Quick Summary

CBD extract needs a **carrier oil** to be absorbed effectively. Common carriers include MCT oil, hemp seed oil, and olive oil. Each has different properties affecting absorption, taste, and additional benefits. Understanding carrier oils helps you choose the best CBD product for your needs.

## Why Carrier Oils Matter

### CBD Needs Fat

**Basic chemistry:**
- CBD is fat-soluble (lipophilic)
- Doesn't dissolve well in water
- Needs oil for proper absorption
- Carrier oils provide this vehicle

### Absorption Impact

**Bioavailability:**
- Different oils absorb differently
- Fatty acid profiles matter
- MCT oil generally absorbs best
- All work, but rates vary

## Key Takeaways

1. **MCT oil is most bioavailable** and commonly used
2. **Hemp seed oil adds nutritional value** but slightly lower absorption
3. **Olive oil works** but has strong taste
4. **All carrier oils deliver CBD** — differences are subtle
5. **Choose based on priority** — absorption vs. nutrition vs. taste
6. **Check labels** to know what you're getting

## My Take

For most people, MCT oil is the best carrier choice. It absorbs efficiently, has minimal taste, and is the industry standard for good reason. If you're focused on getting the most out of your CBD, MCT is the way to go.

Hemp seed oil is a solid second choice, especially if you value the additional omega fatty acids and don't mind the earthy taste. It makes sense philosophically—hemp extract in hemp carrier—and provides extra nutritional benefits.

The differences between carrier oils matter more in theory than practice for most users. All of them effectively deliver CBD. Focus more on the CBD quality itself than obsessing over carrier choice.
