## My Take

CBD crumble is the most user-friendly concentrate option. Its dry texture makes it easier to handle, portion, and load than sticky wax or brittle shatter. If you're curious about CBD concentrates and have appropriate equipment, crumble is a reasonable place to start. That said, it's still a concentrate—not for complete beginners and not as convenient as oils. For most people, standard CBD oil remains more practical, but crumble has its place for those wanting a concentrated experience with easier handling.
