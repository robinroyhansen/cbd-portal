## The Drug Testing Question

## Key Takeaways

1. **Use only THC-free CBD** if drug tested
2. **Verify with lab reports** — trust nothing else
3. **Know your employer policy** and nursing board position
4. **CBD may help** with pain, sleep, and stress
5. **Doesn't impair work** at appropriate doses
6. **Part of overall wellness** — not standalone solution

---

## My Take

Healthcare workers have legitimate reasons to consider CBD—the job is physically and emotionally demanding. The key is doing it safely given the professional context.

THC-free products only if you're subject to drug testing. Period. Your career isn't worth the risk of a positive test from trace THC in full-spectrum products. Broad-spectrum and isolate options are effective and eliminate that risk.

Used appropriately, CBD can be part of a healthcare worker's wellness routine without compromising professional standing.
