## My Take

The CBD market has improved, but you still need to be a discerning shopper. The good news is that quality products are more available than ever; the challenge is identifying them among products that still cut corners.

Focus on verification: if a company provides clear, recent third-party testing that matches their claims, they're likely legitimate. If they can't or won't provide this, move on. There are plenty of transparent companies making quality products.
