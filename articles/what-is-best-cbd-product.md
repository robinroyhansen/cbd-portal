## My Take

The "best" CBD product is the one that fits your life and that you'll actually use consistently. A premium oil sitting unused is worth less than affordable gummies taken daily. Start with what appeals to you, ensure it's quality-tested, and adjust based on experience. Most people eventually find their preferred format.
