## Key Takeaways

1. **Creative blocks** may respond to anxiety reduction
2. **Physical demands** need topical support
3. **Show/exhibition** anxiety manageable
4. **Part of practice**, not replacement
5. **Individual experimentation** needed

---

## My Take

Making art requires vulnerability, and that vulnerability often triggers anxiety that blocks creativity. CBD may help by quieting the anxious voice that criticizes before the work is even made, allowing artists to take risks and experiment.

The physical demands of studio practice are real too—standing, repetitive motions, awkward positions. Topical CBD can support body care that enables sustained creative practice. Take care of your body so you can keep making work.
