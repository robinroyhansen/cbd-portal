## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD supports cycling recovery**
2. **WADA permits CBD** (not THC)
3. **THC-free** for tested cyclists
4. **Sleep improvement** major benefit
5. **Consistent use** during training

## My Take

Cycling creates unique recovery challenges—the sheer volume of training, the specific aches, the sleep debt from early rides. CBD fits well as a recovery support tool that doesn't impair next-day training.

For competitive cyclists, stick to verified THC-free products. The risk of a positive test isn't worth any potential marginal benefit from full-spectrum.
