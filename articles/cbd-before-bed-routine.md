## Key Takeaways

1. **Take 1-2 hours before bed**

## My Take

CBD before bed works best as part of a routine, not a last-minute addition. Taking it 1-2 hours before bed gives time for effects to onset, and pairing it with wind-down activities signals your body that sleep is coming.

Don't expect CBD to force you to sleep like a sedative. It helps create the calm conditions that let natural sleep happen.
