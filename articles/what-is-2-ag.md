## Quick Answer

2-AG (2-Arachidonoylglycerol) is the most abundant [endocannabinoid](/glossary/endocannabinoid) in your body. It acts as a natural chemical messenger that activates [CB1](/glossary/cb1-receptor) and [CB2 receptors](/glossary/cb2-receptor) throughout your [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system). While CBD doesn't directly become 2-AG, it may influence 2-AG levels by affecting the enzymes that break it down.

## What is 2-AG?

2-Arachidonoylglycerol, commonly called 2-AG, is one of two primary endocannabinoids your body produces naturally. The other is [anandamide](/glossary/anandamide) (AEA).

Think of 2-AG as your body's own version of cannabis compounds. It's a lipid (fat-based molecule) that your body makes on demand when cells need to communicate with the endocannabinoid system.

**Key facts about 2-AG:**

- Most abundant endocannabinoid in the body
- Full agonist at CB1 and CB2 receptors (fully activates them)
- Made from arachidonic acid (a fatty acid from diet)
- Broken down by the enzyme MAGL (monoacylglycerol lipase)
- Produced on demand, not stored in cells

## How 2-AG Works

Unlike neurotransmitters that are stored and released, 2-AG is synthesized when needed—a process called "on-demand synthesis."

**The 2-AG signaling process:**

1. **Stimulus:** A cell experiences stress, inflammation, or needs to send a signal
2. **Synthesis:** Enzymes (DAGL) produce 2-AG from membrane lipids
3. **Signaling:** 2-AG travels backward across synapses (retrograde signaling)
4. **Activation:** 2-AG binds to CB1 or CB2 receptors
5. **Response:** Target cell modifies its activity (reduces neurotransmitter release, etc.)
6. **Breakdown:** MAGL enzyme breaks down 2-AG

## 2-AG vs Anandamide

Both are endocannabinoids, but they differ in important ways:

| Property | 2-AG | Anandamide |
|----------|------|------------|
| Abundance | Most abundant | Less abundant |
| CB1 affinity | Lower | Higher |
| CB1 activation | Full agonist | Partial agonist |
| Degradation enzyme | MAGL | FAAH |
| Primary role | Synaptic plasticity | Mood, pain modulation |

2-AG is found at concentrations 170-1000 times higher than anandamide in most tissues, making it the dominant endocannabinoid by quantity.

## Functions of 2-AG in the Body

Research has identified numerous roles for 2-AG:

### Brain and Nervous System
- Modulates synaptic transmission
- Influences learning and memory
- Protects against excitotoxicity (neural damage from overactivation)
- Regulates stress response

### Immune System
- Reduces inflammation through CB2 receptors
- Modulates immune cell migration
- Influences cytokine production

### Metabolism
- Involved in energy balance
- Affects lipid metabolism
- May influence appetite regulation

### Pain Processing
- Reduces pain signaling at spinal level
- Modulates peripheral pain sensation

## How CBD Affects 2-AG

CBD doesn't directly bind to CB1 or CB2 receptors like 2-AG does. Instead, CBD may affect 2-AG signaling indirectly:

**MAGL inhibition:** Some research suggests CBD may weakly inhibit MAGL, the enzyme that breaks down 2-AG. This could theoretically increase 2-AG levels, though the effect appears modest compared to CBD's effects on [anandamide](/glossary/anandamide).

**Receptor modulation:** CBD acts as a negative allosteric modulator at CB1 receptors, potentially changing how 2-AG interacts with these receptors.

**Overall ECS tone:** By affecting multiple components of the endocannabinoid system, CBD may help regulate overall 2-AG signaling.

## 2-AG and Health Conditions

Research has linked 2-AG levels to various conditions:

### Low 2-AG Levels Associated With:
- Chronic pain conditions
- Anxiety disorders
- Some neurological conditions

### High 2-AG Levels Associated With:
- Obesity (elevated in some metabolic disorders)
- Certain inflammatory conditions
- Overeating

The goal isn't necessarily to maximize 2-AG, but to maintain balanced endocannabinoid signaling.

## Supporting Healthy 2-AG Levels

While you can't take 2-AG as a supplement, you can support your endocannabinoid system:

**Dietary factors:**
- Omega-3 fatty acids (precursors to endocannabinoids)
- Moderate alcohol (excessive alcohol depletes endocannabinoids)
- Dark chocolate (contains compounds that inhibit endocannabinoid breakdown)

**Lifestyle factors:**
- Exercise (increases endocannabinoid production)
- Stress management (chronic stress depletes endocannabinoids)
- Adequate sleep

**Cannabinoid support:**
- CBD and other phytocannabinoids may help modulate ECS function
- Full-spectrum products provide multiple cannabinoids
