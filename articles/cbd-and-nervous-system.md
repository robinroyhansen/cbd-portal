## Quick Summary

CBD interacts with the nervous system through multiple pathways including endocannabinoid receptors, serotonin receptors, GABA receptors, and ion channels. These interactions explain CBD's potential effects on anxiety, pain, seizures, and neuroprotection.

---

## Key Takeaways

- CBD affects both central and peripheral nervous systems
- Works through multiple receptor systems (not just cannabinoid receptors)
- May have neuroprotective properties
- Modulates pain signalling pathways
- Anti-inflammatory effects protect neural tissue

---

## Central Nervous System Effects

### Brain Regions Affected

CBD influences:
- **Amygdala** — Fear and anxiety processing
- **Prefrontal cortex** — Decision making, emotional regulation
- **Hippocampus** — Memory, neurogenesis
- **Hypothalamus** — Stress response

### Key Mechanisms

1. **5-HT1A activation** — Anxiety reduction
2. **GABA enhancement** — Calming effects
3. **Glutamate modulation** — Anticonvulsant
4. **Adenosine effects** — Relaxation

## Peripheral Nervous System

### Pain Pathway Modulation

CBD affects pain through:
- TRPV1 receptor activation/desensitisation
- Endocannabinoid enhancement
- Anti-inflammatory effects on nerves
- Potential opioid receptor interaction

### Autonomic Effects

May influence:
- Heart rate variability
- Blood pressure regulation
- Stress response (HPA axis)

---

## Neuroprotection

### How CBD May Protect Nerves

- Antioxidant properties
- Anti-inflammatory effects
- Reduced excitotoxicity
- Calcium regulation
- Research in neurodegenerative diseases

---

## My Take

CBD's nervous system effects are complex and multimodal—which is both why it has broad potential and why effects are often subtle. Understanding these pathways helps set realistic expectations and choose products for specific goals.
