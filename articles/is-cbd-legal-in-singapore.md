## My Take

Singapore is not a destination for CBD users. Full stop. The country's drug laws are among the world's strictest, and CBD is classified as a controlled substance with no exceptions.

I cannot emphasize this enough: do not bring CBD to Singapore. Not CBD oil, not CBD gummies, not CBD cosmetics, not CBD anything. The consequences are severe, and claiming ignorance will not help.

If you use CBD regularly, plan your Singapore trip knowing you'll need to go without for its duration. Talk to your doctor if CBD is medically important to you—they may suggest alternatives that are legal in Singapore.
