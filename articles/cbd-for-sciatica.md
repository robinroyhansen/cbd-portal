## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD may help** manage sciatica symptoms
2. **Not a cure** for underlying causes
3. **Oral CBD** for nerve pain pathway
4. **Combine with** physical therapy
5. **Get proper diagnosis** first

## My Take

Sciatica can be extremely painful, and I understand the appeal of CBD for relief. The neuropathic pain research is supportive, and many people report benefit. But sciatica needs proper evaluation—you need to know what's causing it.

Use CBD as part of a comprehensive approach that includes addressing the underlying cause (often physical therapy). Don't rely on CBD alone while ignoring what's actually going on with your spine.
