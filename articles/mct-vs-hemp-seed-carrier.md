## Quick Summary

MCT oil (from coconut) offers better CBD bioavailability and a neutral taste, while hemp seed oil provides additional nutritional benefits and a "hemp on hemp" appeal. MCT is the industry standard for absorption efficiency; hemp seed oil is valued for its omega fatty acids but has a stronger taste and shorter shelf life. For most users, MCT is the better choice for CBD delivery.

## Key Takeaways

- MCT: Better absorption, neutral taste
- Hemp seed: Nutritious, hemp flavour
- MCT is industry standard for reason
- Hemp seed adds omega fatty acids
- Choice affects taste and efficiency

## Understanding Each Oil

### MCT Oil

**What It Is:**
- Medium-Chain Triglycerides
- Derived from coconut (usually) or palm
- Refined, concentrated
- Industry standard carrier

**Key Properties:**
- Nearly tasteless
- Excellent bioavailability
- Long shelf life
- Thin, light consistency

### Hemp Seed Oil

**What It Is:**
- Pressed from hemp seeds
- Contains no CBD naturally
- Whole-food oil
- Nutritional profile

**Key Properties:**
- Nutty, earthy taste
- Contains omega fatty acids
- Shorter shelf life
- Green tint, thicker consistency

## Direct Comparison

| Factor | MCT Oil | Hemp Seed Oil |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Bioavailability | Highest | Moderate |
| Taste | Neutral | Nutty/earthy |
| Shelf life | Long (1-2 years) | Shorter (6-12 months) |
| Omega fatty acids | No | Yes (omega-3, 6, 9) |
| Colour | Clear | Green tint |
| Consistency | Thin | Thicker |
| Price | Moderate | Moderate |

## Bioavailability Comparison

### Why MCT Absorbs Better

**Unique Absorption:**
- Doesn't require bile for digestion
- Goes directly to liver via portal vein
- Faster metabolism
- More efficient CBD delivery

**Result:**
More CBD reaches your bloodstream.

### Hemp Seed Oil Absorption

**Standard Process:**
- Requires normal fat digestion
- Slower absorption
- Standard bioavailability
- Still effective, just less efficient

### Practical Impact

**For Same CBD Dose:**
- MCT carrier: More CBD absorbed
- Hemp seed carrier: Less CBD absorbed
- Difference may be meaningful

---

## Taste Comparison

### MCT Oil

**Taste Profile:**
- Nearly tasteless
- Very mild
- Doesn't compete with CBD
- Clean, neutral

**Best For:**
Those who dislike strong tastes or want flavoured products.

### Hemp Seed Oil

**Taste Profile:**
- Nutty, earthy
- Distinctly "hempy"
- Strong flavour
- Can be pleasant or off-putting

**Best For:**
Those who enjoy or don't mind hemp taste.

## Nutritional Comparison

### MCT Oil

**Nutritional Value:**
- Fast energy source
- May support ketosis
- No essential fatty acids
- Not a nutritional powerhouse

### Hemp Seed Oil

**Nutritional Value:**
- Omega-3 fatty acids
- Omega-6 fatty acids
- Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA)
- Additional health benefits

**Bonus Benefits:**
- Heart-healthy fats
- Anti-inflammatory potential
- Skin health support

---

## Shelf Life and Stability

### MCT Oil

**Stability:**
- Resistant to oxidation
- Long shelf life (1-2 years)
- Stable at room temperature
- Won't go rancid quickly

### Hemp Seed Oil

**Stability:**
- More prone to oxidation
- Shorter shelf life (6-12 months)
- Benefits from refrigeration
- Can go rancid faster

**Practical Impact:**
Products with hemp seed carrier need more careful storage and faster use.

- But caution if coconut-sensitive

### Hemp Seed Oil

**Allergies:**
- Rare hemp seed allergies exist
- Generally well-tolerated
- Different from coconut concerns
- Alternative if MCT not tolerated

---

## Storage Differences

### MCT-Based Products

**Storage:**
- Room temperature fine
- Dark cabinet preferred
- Long-term stable
- Standard handling

### Hemp Seed-Based Products

**Storage:**
- Refrigeration beneficial
- Use within months of opening
- More temperature sensitive
- Watch for rancidity

---

## Cost Comparison

### Pricing

**Both:**
- Similar base cost
- Product pricing similar
- No significant price advantage
- Quality matters more than carrier

---

## Can You Tell the Difference?

### In Practice

**Taste:**
- Immediately noticeable difference
- Hemp seed has distinct flavour
- MCT is nearly undetectable

**Effects:**
- Both deliver CBD
- Efficiency difference subtle
- Most users won't notice dramatically
- Long-term absorption matters

---

## Industry Perspective

### Why MCT Dominates

**Reasons:**
- Better bioavailability data
- Consumer preference for mild taste
- Longer shelf stability
- More consistent formulation
- Standard for quality products

### Hemp Seed Oil Niche

**Still Used Because:**
- Marketing appeal ("hemp on hemp")
- Nutritional benefits
- Customer preference
- Whole-food positioning

## My Take

For pure CBD delivery, MCT oil is the better carrier—it absorbs more efficiently, tastes neutral, and stays fresh longer. That's why it's the industry standard. Hemp seed oil isn't bad; it adds nutritional benefits and has appeal for those who want "hemp on hemp." But if your primary goal is getting CBD into your system effectively, MCT wins. If you care about the omega fatty acids or prefer the hemp taste, hemp seed oil is fine. Just know that you might be absorbing slightly less CBD per dose.
