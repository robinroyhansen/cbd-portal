## My Take

The holidays are supposed to be enjoyable, but for many people, they're a stressful endurance test. CBD can help take the edge off—calmer at family gatherings, less overwhelmed by social demands, better sleep despite schedule chaos.

But CBD isn't a substitute for boundaries. You can still say no to some events, set limits on spending, and protect your wellbeing. Use CBD to support a healthier approach to holidays, not to white-knuckle through an overwhelming schedule you should have trimmed.
