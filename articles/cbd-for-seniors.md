## Special Considerations for Seniors

### Drug Interactions

**Most important concern:**

- Blood thinners especially relevant
- Always check interactions

**High-risk medications:**
- Warfarin and other blood thinners
- Heart medications
- Blood pressure medications
- Seizure medications
- Some antidepressants

### Increased Sensitivity

Older adults may be more sensitive:
- Lower doses may be effective
- Side effects may be more pronounced
- Start lower than younger adults would
- Increase more gradually

### Liver Function

Age affects liver:
- CBD is liver-metabolized
- Liver function may be reduced
- Medications also liver-processed
- Extra caution warranted

## Safe Approach for Seniors

### Step 1: Consult Healthcare Provider

Before starting CBD:
- List all current medications

### Step 2: Start Very Low

**Recommended starting dose for seniors:**
- 5-10mg initially
- Lower than typical adult starting dose
- Allows assessment of sensitivity
- Can always increase

### Step 3: Increase Slowly

- Increase by 5mg at a time
- Wait 5-7 days between increases
- Find minimum effective dose
- More isn't necessarily better

### Step 4: Monitor Carefully

Watch for:
- New symptoms
- Changes in medication effects
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Unusual drowsiness
- Any concerning changes

## Drug Interactions: What Seniors Need to Know

### The Grapefruit Rule

If any medication warns against grapefruit, CBD may also interact. Common medications with grapefruit warnings:

### Blood Thinners

**Special attention required:**
- CBD can increase warfarin effects

|-----------------|-----------------|
| Blood thinners | High |

## My Take

CBD can be appropriate for seniors, but the approach needs to be more careful than for younger adults. The medication interaction issue is real—many seniors take multiple drugs that CBD can interact with.

The good news is that many seniors do well with CBD for pain, sleep, and anxiety. The key is starting lower, going slower, and communicating with healthcare providers.

If you're a senior considering CBD, don't skip the healthcare provider consultation. Bring your medication list, ask about interactions, and approach CBD as you would any new addition to your health routine—cautiously and informed.
