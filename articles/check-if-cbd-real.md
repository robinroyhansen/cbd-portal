## Quick Summary

Verifying CBD authenticity requires checking third-party lab results, researching the brand, and understanding product labelling. With mislabelling common in the industry, taking steps to verify your CBD is genuine protects both your health and investment.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Third-party COA is the primary verification tool
- Match batch numbers between product and COA
- Research brand reputation and history
- Be wary of unrealistic claims or prices
- Physical product characteristics can indicate quality

---

## Step 1: Check the COA

### What to Verify

**Cannabinoid Profile**
- CBD content matches label (within 10%)
- THC within legal limits
- Spectrum type matches claims
- All cannabinoids listed

**Batch Information**
- Batch number on COA
- Matches product batch number
- Recent test date
- Complete testing panels

### How to Obtain COA

1. Check company website (usually under "Lab Results")
2. Scan QR code on product
3. Email customer service
4. Request by batch number

### Red Flags

- No COA available
- Generic COA (not batch-specific)
- COA from unknown lab
- Numbers don't match product

---

## Step 2: Verify the Lab

### Legitimate Labs

**Should Have:**
- ISO 17025 accreditation
- State licensing (where required)
- Physical address and contact
- Verifiable online presence

**How to Check:**
- Search lab name online
- Verify accreditation status
- Contact lab directly if needed
- Check they actually exist

### Fake Lab Warning Signs

- No online presence
- Can't verify accreditation
- Generic or template COAs
- Contact information doesn't work

---

## Step 3: Research the Brand

### Investigate

**Company Background:**
- How long in business?
- Physical address verifiable?
- Real people behind company?
- Industry reputation?

**Online Presence:**
- Professional website?
- Active social media?
- Customer reviews (multiple sources)?
- Press coverage or mentions?

### Verification Methods

- Search company name + "reviews"
- Check Better Business Bureau
- Look for industry awards/certifications
- Verify physical address exists

---

## Step 4: Examine the Product

### Physical Indicators

**Packaging Quality:**
- Professional appearance
- Complete labelling
- Batch number present
- Expiration date included
- Child-resistant (if required)

**Product Appearance:**
- Appropriate colour for type
- Correct consistency
- No unusual separation
- Proper seal intact

### Label Requirements

Should include:
- CBD content per unit
- Total CBD content
- Ingredient list
- Batch/lot number
- Company contact information
- Suggested use

---

## Step 5: Price Reality Check

### What Quality Costs

Legitimate CBD typically costs:
- Oils: £0.05-0.15 per mg CBD
- Much cheaper raises questions
- Extremely expensive doesn't guarantee quality

### Suspiciously Low Prices

May indicate:
- Less CBD than claimed
- Diluted product
- No testing performed
- Poor quality source
- Counterfeit product

---

## Common Scams to Avoid

### Fake Products

**Counterfeit Brands:**
- Mimics known brand packaging
- Sold through unauthorised channels
- Often significantly cheaper
- Quality unverified

**Synthetic Cannabinoids:**
- Not natural CBD
- May be dangerous
- Sometimes in cheap products
- Requires testing to detect

### Marketing Scams

**Unrealistic Claims:**
- "Cures" diseases
- Miracle testimonials
- Celebrity endorsements (often fake)
- Too-good-to-be-true offers

## My Take

Verification takes ten minutes and protects both your health and money. The CBD industry has quality issues, but legitimate products absolutely exist. A company that makes verification easy—with accessible COAs and transparent practices—is worth supporting. If verification is difficult, that itself is a red flag.
