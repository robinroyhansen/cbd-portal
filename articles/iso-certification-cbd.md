## Quick Summary

ISO certification indicates that a CBD company or testing laboratory meets international standards for quality management, testing accuracy, or food safety. Common relevant certifications include ISO 17025 (lab accreditation), ISO 9001 (quality management), and ISO 22000 (food safety). While not required, ISO certification demonstrates commitment to quality and provides third-party verification of standards.

## How to Verify ISO Certification

### Checking Validity

**Steps:**
1. Ask for certificate
2. Note certification body
3. Check certificate number
4. Verify with certification body
5. Confirm scope covers relevant activities

### What to Look For

**Legitimate Certificates Show:**
- Certification body name
- Certificate number
- Scope of certification
- Expiry date
- Accreditation marks

### Red Flags

**Suspicious If:**
- Can't provide certificate
- Vague claims ("ISO compliant")
- Unknown certification body
- Expired certificates
- Can't verify with issuer

---

## ISO Certification Process

### How Companies Get Certified

**General Process:**
1. Implement required systems
2. Document procedures
3. Apply to certification body
4. Undergo audit
5. Address any findings
6. Receive certification
7. Maintain through surveillance audits

### Ongoing Requirements

- Annual surveillance audits
- Full re-certification (usually every 3 years)
- Continuous compliance
- Documentation maintenance

## Does ISO Guarantee Quality?

### What It Does

**ISO Certification Shows:**
- Systems are in place
- Processes are documented
- External verification occurred
- Commitment to standards

### What It Doesn't Do

**ISO Doesn't Guarantee:**
- Every product is perfect
- No problems will ever occur
- Better than all non-certified
- Automatic quality

### Perspective

ISO is a strong indicator but not absolute assurance. It's one piece of the quality puzzle.

## ISO in the CBD Industry

### Current State

**Reality:**
- Not all companies have ISO
- Not required by regulations
- Becoming more common
- Differentiator for quality

### Looking for ISO

**When Evaluating CBD:**
- Check if testing lab is ISO 17025
- Note if company mentions ISO 9001
- Consider as quality indicator
- Not sole deciding factor

---

## What If No ISO?

### Not Necessarily Bad

**Consider:**
- Small companies may not have it
- Cost can be prohibitive
- Other quality indicators exist
- GMP may be present instead

### Minimum Standards

**At Minimum Look For:**
- Third-party testing (any accredited lab)
- Quality controls mentioned
- Transparent practices
- Good track record

---

## ISO Claims to Verify

### Common Claims

**"ISO Certified Lab Testing"**
- Lab should be ISO 17025 accredited
- Verify with lab directly

**"ISO 9001 Certified"**
- Ask for certificate
- Check it covers CBD operations
- Verify currency

**"ISO Compliant"**
- Weaker claim than "certified"
- May mean following standards without certification
- Ask for clarification

---

## My Take

ISO certification is a valuable quality indicator but not mandatory for a good CBD product. The most relevant certification is ISO 17025 for testing labs—if your CBD's COA comes from an ISO 17025 lab, that testing is more trustworthy. For CBD companies themselves, ISO 9001 shows quality commitment. But many excellent smaller brands don't have formal ISO certification due to cost and complexity. Use ISO as one factor among many when evaluating CBD quality, not as the only criterion.
