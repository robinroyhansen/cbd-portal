## Quick Answer

Ocimene is a [terpene](/knowledge/what-are-terpenes) with a sweet, herbal, and woody aroma with citrus undertones. Found in many plants as part of their defense mechanism, ocimene research suggests antifungal, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties. It's less common in cannabis but contributes to complex, sweet aromatic profiles.

## Plants' Defense Mechanism

In nature, ocimene serves as a plant defense:
- Released when plants are damaged
- Attracts predators of plant pests
- Acts as a natural insecticide
- Deters herbivores

This protective role hints at its bioactivity potential.

## Ocimene in CBD Products

Products with notable ocimene may feature:
- Sweet, herbaceous profiles
- Complex aromatic blends
- Strains like Strawberry Cough, Golden Goat
- Products emphasizing diverse terpene content

## Low Boiling Point Note

Ocimene's relatively low boiling point (100°C/212°F) means:
- It evaporates easily
- May be reduced in highly processed products
- Fresh, minimally processed extracts retain more
- Important for vaporization temperatures

---

## Research Status

Ocimene research includes:
- Antiviral mechanism studies
- Antifungal activity research
- Role in plant defense systems
- Traditional medicine applications

Specific research on ocimene in cannabis contexts is limited.

## My Take

Ocimene isn't a headline terpene, but it adds a pleasant sweetness to cannabis profiles that I appreciate. When I encounter CBD products with that subtle sweet-herbal quality, ocimene is often present. For those tracking terpenes in their CBD use, ocimene contributes to entourage effect complexity even when not dominant.
