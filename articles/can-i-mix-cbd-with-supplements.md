## Building a Supplement Stack

### Recommended Approach

1. **Start with CBD alone** — Establish baseline
2. **Add supplements one at a time** — Identify effects
3. **Wait between additions** — 1-2 weeks
4. **Note any changes** — Keep simple log
5. **Adjust as needed** — Based on response

### Don't Start Everything at Once

If you experience issues, you won't know the cause.

## My Take

Most common supplements combine safely with CBD—your daily vitamin D or magnesium isn't a concern. Where you need to be careful is with supplements that have sedative effects (like melatonin or valerian) or blood-thinning properties (like high-dose fish oil). The key is starting with one thing at a time, using quality products, and paying attention to how you feel. When in doubt, consult a healthcare provider.
