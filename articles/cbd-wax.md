## Quick Summary

CBD wax is a concentrated CBD extract with a soft, waxy texture, typically containing 60-90% CBD. It's made through extraction and purging processes similar to shatter, but with agitation during cooling that creates its characteristic opaque, waxy consistency. CBD wax is used primarily through dabbing or vaporisation.

## Key Takeaways

- Soft, opaque, waxy texture
- High CBD concentration (60-90%)
- Used via dabbing/vaporising
- More forgiving than shatter
- For experienced users

## What Is CBD Wax?

### Definition

CBD wax is a cannabis concentrate with a malleable, waxy consistency. The opacity and texture result from agitation during the post-extraction cooling process, which creates tiny air bubbles and crystalline structures.

### Appearance and Texture

**Visual:**
- Opaque, not translucent
- Golden to amber colour
- Soft, malleable consistency
- May vary from buttery to crumbly

---

## Types of CBD Wax

### Budder

**Characteristics:**
- Soft, butter-like texture
- Smooth consistency
- Easy to work with
- Whipped during processing

### Badder/Batter

**Characteristics:**
- Thicker than budder
- Cake batter consistency
- Sticky texture
- Pliable

### Honeycomb Wax

**Characteristics:**
- Full of holes (honeycomb appearance)
- Lighter texture
- Air pockets visible
- Result of purging process

## How CBD Wax Is Made

### Extraction

**Common Methods:**
- BHO (Butane Hash Oil) extraction
- CO2 extraction
- Ethanol extraction

### Processing

**Key Steps:**
1. CBD extracted from hemp
2. Solvents purged under vacuum
3. **Agitation during cooling** (key difference from shatter)
4. Results in opaque, waxy texture

### Why Agitation Matters

Agitation introduces air and disrupts crystalline structure, creating:
- Opaque appearance
- Softer texture
- Different consistency from shatter

## CBD Wax vs. Other Concentrates

### Comparison

| Concentrate | Texture | Handling | Stability |
|-------------|---------|----------|-----------|
| Wax | Soft, malleable | Easy | Moderate |
| Shatter | Hard, glass-like | Harder | High |
| Crumble | Dry, crumbly | Moderate | Good |
| Oil/Distillate | Liquid | Easy | Variable |

### Why Choose Wax?

- Easier to handle than shatter
- Doesn't break into pieces
- Good potency
- Versatile use

## How to Use CBD Wax

### Dabbing

**Standard Method:**
1. Heat dab nail to appropriate temperature
2. Allow slight cooling (low-temp dabbing preferred)
3. Use dab tool to apply wax
4. Inhale vapour
5. Cap if desired

**Temperature Guide:**
- Low temp (150-230°C): Better flavour
- High temp (230-300°C): More vapour, less flavour

### Vaporising

**Concentrate Vaporiser:**
- Use wax-compatible device
- Load appropriate chamber
- Set temperature
- Inhale

### Adding to Flower

**Twaxing:**
- Add small piece to bowl
- Mix with CBD flower
- Increases potency
- Combines benefits

### Making Edibles

**After Decarboxylation:**
- Heat to activate CBD
- Infuse into oils/butter
- Use in recipes
- Calculate dosing carefully

## Dosing CBD Wax

### Potency Awareness

**Concentration:**
- Typically 60-90% CBD
- Small amounts = significant CBD
- Much stronger than flower

### Starting Dose

**Guidelines:**
- Rice grain size or smaller
- Calculate: dose weight × CBD percentage
- Start with 10-25mg CBD equivalent
- Increase gradually

### Example Calculation

- Wax is 80% CBD
- 50mg portion = 40mg CBD
- Start smaller than this

---

## Quality Indicators

### What to Look For

**Good Quality Wax:**
- Consistent texture
- Pleasant aroma
- Golden to amber colour
- No dark spots
- Lab tested

### Testing Requirements

**Essential Tests:**
- Cannabinoid profile
- Residual solvents
- Pesticides
- Heavy metals
- Microbial

### Red Flags

**Avoid If:**
- Very dark colour
- Chemical smell
- No lab reports
- Extremely cheap
- Unknown source

---

## Safety Considerations

### Residual Solvents

**Important:**
- Must be properly purged
- Lab testing confirms safety
- Reputable extraction matters
- Health risk if not purged

### Potency

**Be Careful:**
- Very concentrated
- Easy to overconsume
- Start extremely small
- Not for beginners

### Inhalation

**Consider:**
- Respiratory impact
- Proper technique needed
- Quality equipment matters
- Not suitable for all

---

## Storage

### How to Store CBD Wax

**Best Practices:**
- Silicone container preferred
- Cool, dark location
- Away from heat
- Sealed container

**Temperature:**
- Room temperature generally fine
- Refrigerator can make too hard
- Avoid heat (will melt)

### Shelf Life

- Several months to a year
- Quality degrades with exposure
- Watch for drying out
- Check for mould or changes

## Wax vs. Oil: Which to Choose?

### CBD Wax

**Pros:**
- Higher concentration
- Fast onset
- Potent effects
- Full terpene experience

**Cons:**
- Equipment needed
- Learning curve
- Less convenient
- Not for beginners

### CBD Oil

**Pros:**
- No equipment needed
- Easy dosing
- Convenient
- Beginner-friendly

**Cons:**
- Lower bioavailability
- Slower onset
- Less potent

## Who Should Use CBD Wax

### Good Choice If

- Experienced with concentrates
- Have dabbing equipment
- Want potent, fast CBD
- Enjoy concentrate experience
- Can handle careful dosing

### Not Recommended If

- New to CBD
- No appropriate equipment
- Prefer convenience
- Have respiratory issues
- Need precise dosing

---

## My Take

CBD wax is more approachable than shatter—the softer texture makes it easier to handle and portion. It's still a concentrate product best suited for experienced users with appropriate equipment. For most people, CBD oil remains more practical. But if you're experienced with concentrates and want a potent, fast-acting CBD experience with good terpene preservation, quality CBD wax is a solid option. Always verify lab testing, especially residual solvent results.
