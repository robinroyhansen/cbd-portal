## Quick Summary

CBD is extracted from hemp using several methods, each with advantages and drawbacks. CO2 extraction is considered the gold standard for purity and safety. Ethanol extraction is efficient and scalable. Hydrocarbon extraction is effective but raises safety concerns. Solventless methods are cleanest but often less efficient.

## Key Takeaways

- CO2 extraction produces the cleanest, safest CBD
- Ethanol extraction is efficient and widely used
- Extraction method affects purity, terpene content, and safety
- Quality testing matters regardless of extraction method
- "Full-spectrum" products preserve more compounds during extraction

## CO2 Extraction

### How It Works

Supercritical CO2 extraction:
1. CO2 pressurised until supercritical (liquid-gas hybrid)
2. Supercritical CO2 passes through hemp material
3. Cannabinoids and terpenes dissolve into CO2
4. Pressure released, CO2 evaporates
5. Clean extract remains

### Advantages

- No solvent residue
- Precise compound selection
- Preserves terpenes at lower temperatures
- Environmentally friendly
- Produces clean, safe extracts

### Disadvantages

- Expensive equipment
- Slower process
- Requires expertise
- Higher production costs

### Best For

- Premium CBD products
- Full-spectrum extracts
- Products emphasising purity

## Ethanol Extraction

### How It Works

1. Hemp soaked in food-grade ethanol
2. Cannabinoids and terpenes dissolve
3. Plant material removed
4. Ethanol evaporated
5. Extract purified further

### Advantages

- Efficient and scalable
- Relatively safe solvent
- Good for large volumes
- Cost-effective
- FDA-approved solvent

### Disadvantages

- May extract chlorophyll (green colour)
- Can damage some terpenes
- Requires thorough purification
- Fire hazard during production

### Best For

- Large-scale production
- Cost-effective products
- Products that will be further refined

---

## Hydrocarbon Extraction

### How It Works

Uses butane, propane, or hexane:
1. Solvent passes through hemp
2. Cannabinoids extracted
3. Solvent purged (evaporated)
4. Extract refined

### Advantages

- Very efficient
- Preserves terpenes well
- Lower equipment costs
- Fast processing

### Disadvantages

- Residual solvent concerns
- Flammable/explosive
- Requires thorough purging
- Stricter safety requirements

### Best For

- Concentrates (when properly purged)
- Terpene-rich extracts
- Products with rigorous testing

---

## Solventless Extraction

### Methods Include

- **Rosin pressing** — Heat and pressure
- **Ice water extraction** — Cold water and agitation
- **Dry sifting** — Mechanical separation

### Advantages

- No solvent residue possible
- "Clean" marketing appeal
- Simple process
- Artisanal quality

### Disadvantages

- Lower yields
- Less efficient
- Harder to scale
- May not be cost-effective

## Comparing Methods

| Method | Purity | Efficiency | Cost | Best For |
|--------|--------|------------|------|----------|
| CO2 | Excellent | Good | High | Premium products |
| Ethanol | Good | Excellent | Medium | Large scale |
| Hydrocarbon | Good* | Excellent | Medium | Concentrates |
| Solventless | Excellent | Low | Variable | Artisanal |

*When properly purged

## What Consumers Should Know

### Checking Quality

Regardless of extraction method:
- Third-party testing essential
- Check for residual solvents
- Verify cannabinoid content
- Look for contaminant testing

### Questions to Ask

- What extraction method is used?
- Is there residual solvent testing?
- What quality certifications exist?

---

## My Take

For consumers, the extraction method matters less than the final product quality. A well-purged hydrocarbon extract with clean test results can be perfectly safe, while a poorly processed CO2 extract could have issues. Focus on third-party testing results rather than marketing claims about extraction methods. That said, CO2 extraction generally produces the cleanest products with fewest concerns.
