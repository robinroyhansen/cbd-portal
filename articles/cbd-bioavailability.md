## Quick Summary

Bioavailability refers to how much CBD actually reaches your bloodstream. Oral CBD has notably low bioavailability (6-19%), while sublingual (20-35%) and inhaled (30-40%) methods deliver more. Understanding bioavailability helps you choose products and calculate effective doses.

## Key Takeaways

- Oral CBD bioavailability is only 6-19%
- Sublingual absorption is significantly better (20-35%)
- Inhalation provides fastest, highest absorption (30-40%)
- Taking CBD with fatty foods increases absorption up to 4x
- Nano/water-soluble CBD may improve bioavailability

## Bioavailability by Method

### Oral (Capsules, Edibles, Swallowed Oil)

**Bioavailability: 6-19%**

Why so low:
- First-pass metabolism in liver
- CBD is fat-soluble, hard to absorb
- Digestive tract inefficiency
- Significant breakdown before reaching bloodstream

Implications:
- Need higher doses for effect
- Longer onset but longer duration
- Most economical method (counterintuitively)

### Sublingual (Oil Under Tongue)

**Bioavailability: 20-35%**

Why better:
- Bypasses first-pass metabolism partially
- Absorbed through oral mucosa
- Directly enters bloodstream
- Remaining amount still swallowed

Technique matters:
- Hold 30-60 seconds minimum
- Under tongue where blood vessels concentrate
- Don't swallow immediately

### Inhalation (Vaping)

**Bioavailability: 30-40%**

Why highest:
- Direct lung absorption
- Bypasses digestive system entirely
- Fast onset (minutes)
- Efficient delivery

Concerns:
- Lung health considerations
- Shorter duration
- Less discreet
- Product quality crucial

### Topical (Creams, Balms)

**Bioavailability: Local only (mostly)**

How it works:
- CBD absorbed into local tissue
- Doesn't significantly reach bloodstream
- Works on local cannabinoid receptors
- Different mechanism than systemic use

Best for localised issues.

## Improving Bioavailability

### With Food

Taking CBD with fats significantly increases absorption:
- Up to 4x improvement with fatty meal
- MCT oil as carrier already helps
- Eating before or with CBD recommended
- Type of fat matters less than presence of fat

### Nano/Water-Soluble CBD

Claims and reality:
- Smaller particles may absorb faster
- Marketing often exceeds evidence
- May improve oral bioavailability
- Not magic—still subject to metabolism

### Liposomal CBD

How it works:
- CBD encased in lipid bubbles
- May protect through digestion
- Improved absorption claimed
- Research still emerging

## Practical Implications

### Dose Calculation

Understanding bioavailability helps:
- 100mg oral CBD → ~10-19mg absorbed
- 100mg sublingual → ~20-35mg absorbed
- Adjust expectations accordingly
- Don't compare doses across methods directly

### Cost-Effectiveness

Consider:
- Cheaper methods may require more product
- Calculate cost per absorbed mg
- Sublingual often best value
- Oral costs more for same effect

---

## My Take

Bioavailability explains why CBD dosing is so individual and why some people think CBD "doesn't work." If you're taking 25mg orally, you might only absorb 3-5mg. Switching to sublingual or taking with fatty foods can dramatically change your experience. This isn't marketing—it's pharmacology.
