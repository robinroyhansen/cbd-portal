## Key Takeaways

1. **Limited research** on CBD for RLS
2. **May help** through relaxation and sleep support
3. **Evening dosing** makes sense
4. **Combine with** lifestyle measures
5. **See a doctor** for proper evaluation

## My Take

RLS is frustrating because it specifically disrupts the rest you need. CBD's muscle-relaxing and sleep-supporting properties make it theoretically appealing, and some people report benefit.

However, I'd approach RLS with realistic expectations—evidence is limited. Also get proper medical evaluation, as RLS can sometimes indicate underlying issues (like iron deficiency) that have specific treatments.
