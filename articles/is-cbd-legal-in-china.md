## Quick Answer

CBD is in a **complex legal situation in China**. While China is the world's largest hemp producer and extracts CBD for export, domestic CBD products are not legally sold to consumers. Hemp cultivation is legal in certain provinces, but CBD products are not approved for sale within China. **Do not bring CBD to China.**

## China's Unusual Position

### Hemp Production Powerhouse

The paradox:
- China grows most of world's hemp
- Major CBD extractor for export
- Supplies global CBD market
- But domestic sales prohibited

### Legal Framework

Current situation:
- Industrial hemp legal in some provinces
- CBD extraction for export permitted
- Consumer CBD products not legal
- No regulatory framework for sales

---

## What's Not Allowed

### Consumer Products

Banned within China:
- CBD oils for consumers
- CBD edibles
- CBD cosmetics (for sale)
- CBD supplements

### No Market Exists

Reality:
- No CBD shops
- No online sales legally
- No pharmacy availability
- Export-only industry

---

## For Travelers

### Visiting China

Critical advice:
- Do not bring CBD products
- Not available to purchase
- Cannabis products strictly controlled
- Avoid any complications

### Hong Kong Note

Different system:
- Hong Kong has separate laws
- CBD products available there
- But mainland China different
- Don't confuse the two

---

## The Export Industry

### China's Role

Global supply chain:
- Grows hemp in Yunnan, Heilongjiang
- Extracts CBD
- Exports to US, Europe, etc.
- Doesn't sell domestically

### Why the Paradox?

Reasons:
- Export revenue valuable
- Domestic cannabis stigma
- Regulatory complexity
- Policy hasn't caught up

## Key Takeaways

1. **China produces CBD** but bans domestic sales
2. **Hemp cultivation legal** in some provinces
3. **No consumer market** exists
4. **Do not bring CBD** when visiting
5. **Unique situation** — export OK, domestic sale banned

---

## My Take

China's CBD situation is uniquely paradoxical. The country produces much of the world's CBD but doesn't allow its own citizens to buy it. If you're visiting China, don't bring CBD and don't expect to find it there. The export-focused industry doesn't translate to consumer availability.
