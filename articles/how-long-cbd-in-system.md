## Quick Summary

CBD typically stays in your system for 2-5 days after occasional use, but can remain detectable for 2-4 weeks with regular use. The exact duration depends on dosage, frequency of use, metabolism, body fat, and the sensitivity of any tests. For most purposes, CBD clears relatively quickly compared to THC.

## Key Takeaways

- CBD half-life is 18-32 hours
- Occasional use: 2-5 days
- Regular use: 2-4 weeks
- Fat-soluble, so stores in fat
- Generally faster clearance than THC

## CBD Half-Life

### What Is Half-Life?

The time it takes for half the CBD to leave your system.

**CBD Half-Life:**
- Approximately 18-32 hours
- Varies by individual
- Method of use affects this
- Research still evolving

### What This Means

After one dose:
- 24 hours: ~50% remains
- 48 hours: ~25% remains
- 72 hours: ~12.5% remains
- 5 days: Minimal amounts

---

## Detection Times by Use Pattern

### Occasional Use (1-2x per week)

**Typical Detection Window:**
- Blood: 1-2 days
- Urine: 2-5 days
- Saliva: 1-3 days

### Regular Use (Daily)

**Typical Detection Window:**
- Blood: 5-7 days
- Urine: 1-2 weeks
- Saliva: 3-5 days

### Heavy Use (High Doses Daily)

**Typical Detection Window:**
- Blood: 1-2 weeks
- Urine: 2-4 weeks
- Saliva: 1 week

## Factors Affecting Clearance

### Body Factors

**Metabolism:**
- Faster metabolism = quicker clearance
- Age affects metabolism
- Activity level matters

**Body Fat:**
- CBD is fat-soluble
- More body fat = longer storage
- Released gradually from fat

**Hydration:**
- Better hydration may help elimination
- Not a rapid flush method
- General health factor

### Usage Factors

**Dose:**
- Higher doses = longer detection
- Accumulation with regular use
- More CBD to process

**Frequency:**
- Single use clears fastest
- Regular use builds up
- Daily use extends detection

**Method:**
- Inhaled clears faster
- Edibles may linger longer
- Topicals minimal systemic presence

---

## CBD and Drug Tests

### Standard Drug Tests

**What They Test For:**
- THC metabolites typically
- Not CBD specifically
- Standard panels don't include CBD

### The THC Concern

**Why It Matters:**
- Full-spectrum CBD contains trace THC
- Could potentially trigger positive
- More likely with high doses
- More likely with regular use

### Minimising Risk

**If Drug Testing Is a Concern:**
- Use CBD isolate (zero THC)
- Use broad-spectrum (THC removed)
- Verify with COA
- Consider abstaining before tests

---

## Detection in Different Tests

### Urine Tests

**Most Common:**
- Tests for THC-COOH metabolite
- CBD itself not typically tested
- Full-spectrum may cause issues
- Detection: days to weeks

### Blood Tests

**Less Common:**
- Shorter detection window
- Active CBD levels
- Used for recent use
- Detection: hours to days

### Saliva Tests

**Occasionally Used:**
- Short detection window
- Recent use detection
- Less common for employment
- Detection: hours to days

### Hair Tests

**Rare for CBD:**
- Long detection window
- Not typically used for CBD
- Can detect over months
- Expensive and uncommon

## Clearance Timeline

### After Single Dose

| Time | Approximate CBD Remaining |
|------|--------------------------|
| 6 hours | 75-80% |
| 24 hours | 50% |
| 48 hours | 25% |
| 72 hours | 12% |
| 5 days | <5% |

### After Regular Use (Stopping)

| Time | Status |
|------|--------|
| 24-48 hours | Acute effects gone |
| 3-5 days | Significant clearance |
| 1-2 weeks | Most cleared |
| 2-4 weeks | Below detection usually |

---

## When Clearance Matters

### Drug Testing

**Considerations:**
- Know your test type
- Understand product THC content
- Time your cessation
- Use THC-free if needed

### Medical Procedures

**Before Surgery:**
- Stop CBD 1-2 weeks before
- Inform medical team
- Follow doctor's instructions
- Not just about clearance

### Medication Changes

**When Starting New Medications:**
- Consult with doctor
- Allow CBD to clear if advised
- Avoid interaction concerns

---

## Speeding Up Clearance

### May Help

**Supportive Measures:**
- Stay hydrated
- Maintain activity level
- Eat normally
- Time and metabolism do the work

### Won't Help Significantly

**Common Myths:**
- "Detox" products
- Excessive water
- Supplements claiming to flush
- Extreme measures

### Best Approach

Simply stop using and allow natural clearance time.

## Important Distinctions

### CBD vs. THC Clearance

| Factor | CBD | THC |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Half-life | 18-32 hours | 1-10 days |
| Fat storage | Yes | Yes (more) |
| Detection focus | Rarely tested | Primary target |
| Typical clearance | Days to weeks | Weeks to months |

### Why CBD Clears Faster

- Different metabolic pathway
- Less accumulation typically
- Not the focus of standard tests
- But full-spectrum products contain THC

---

## For Surgery or Medical Procedures

### Recommendations

**Before Planned Procedures:**
- Stop 1-2 weeks before
- Inform anaesthesiologist
- Follow medical team advice
- Document your usage

**Why It Matters:**
- Drug interactions
- Anaesthesia concerns
- Not just about detection

---

## My Take

For most people, CBD clears from the system relatively quickly—within a week for occasional users, a few weeks for regular users. The bigger concern is usually the trace THC in full-spectrum products if you're subject to drug testing. If testing is a concern, switch to CBD isolate well before any test, or consider broad-spectrum verified to contain no THC. For medical procedures, simply follow your healthcare team's guidance about when to stop.
