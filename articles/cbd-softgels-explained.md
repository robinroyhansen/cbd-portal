## Key Takeaways

1. **Softgels combine** oil benefits with capsule convenience

3. **Pre-measured doses** ensure consistency
4. **Tasteless and easy** to incorporate into routine
5. **Good for daily** consistent use

## My Take

Softgels are my top recommendation for most people starting CBD or wanting a simple daily routine. You get the benefits of liquid CBD oil without the measuring, taste, or mess. The absorption is better than hard capsules, and the convenience factor is high.

The only drawback is less flexibility—you can't easily take "half a dose" with softgels. But for most people seeking consistent daily CBD, softgels hit the sweet spot.
