## My Take

Geraniol adds a sophisticated floral quality that elevates CBD products from medicinal to pleasant. The early neuroprotective research particularly interests me—as someone in this industry for over a decade, I've seen how preliminary terpene research often leads to meaningful applications. While I wouldn't choose a product solely for geraniol content, its presence indicates a complex, potentially more effective terpene profile.
