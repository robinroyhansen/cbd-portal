## Quick Summary

CBD is generally safe during intermittent fasting for wellness purposes, as pure CBD oil contains minimal calories and doesn't significantly impact insulin. However, for medical fasts (pre-surgery, blood tests), CBD should typically be avoided following healthcare provider instructions. The carrier oil in CBD products contains some calories, but not enough to break most wellness fasts.

## Key Takeaways

- Wellness fasting: usually compatible
- Medical fasting: follow doctor's orders
- CBD itself has no calories
- Carrier oil adds minimal calories
- Won't significantly break metabolic fast

## Types of Fasting and CBD

### Intermittent Fasting (Wellness)

**Common Protocols:**
- 16:8 fasting
- 20:4 fasting
- OMAD (One Meal a Day)
- 5:2 diet

**CBD Compatibility:**
Generally compatible—pure CBD oil unlikely to break these fasts in a meaningful way.

### Medical Fasting

**Examples:**
- Pre-surgery fasting
- Before blood tests
- Before certain procedures
- Doctor-ordered fasts

**CBD Compatibility:**
Follow medical instructions exactly. Usually best to avoid CBD before medical procedures.

### Religious Fasting

**Examples:**
- Ramadan
- Christian fasting periods
- Jewish fasts
- Other religious observances

**CBD Compatibility:**
Depends on specific religious guidelines. Consult religious authority.

## Does CBD Break a Fast?

### Pure CBD

**Calories:** Essentially zero
**Insulin Impact:** None
**Autophagy Impact:** Likely minimal

**Assessment:** Pure CBD does not break a fast.

### CBD Oil (With Carrier)

**Carrier Oil Calories:**
- MCT oil: ~8 calories per ml
- Typical dose (0.5-1ml): 4-8 calories
- Full dropper: ~8-15 calories

**Assessment:** Very minimal calories, unlikely to significantly impact fasting benefits.

### CBD Gummies

**Additional Ingredients:**
- Sugar: 2-5g per gummy
- Total calories: 10-20 per gummy

**Assessment:** Will break a strict fast due to sugar/calories.

## Fasting Goals and CBD

### If Your Goal Is Ketosis

**CBD Oil:** Compatible
- Won't kick you out of ketosis
- Pure fat (carrier oil) is keto-friendly
- No carbohydrates

### If Your Goal Is Autophagy

**CBD Oil:** Likely compatible
- Very low caloric load
- Unlikely to trigger mTOR significantly
- May not interfere

**Note:** Autophagy research is complex; CBD impact not well-studied.

### If Your Goal Is Caloric Restriction

**CBD Oil:** Minimal impact
- 5-15 calories per dose
- Negligible in context
- Won't meaningfully affect deficit

### If Your Goal Is Insulin Sensitivity

**CBD Oil:** No significant impact
- No insulin response from CBD
- Fat doesn't spike insulin
- Should be compatible

## Medical Fasting: Special Considerations

### Pre-Surgical Fasting

**CBD Should Be Avoided Because:**
- Drug interactions with anaesthesia
- Potential effects on bleeding
- Not just about eating
- Follow surgical team instructions

### Pre-Blood Test Fasting

**Considerations:**
- May affect liver enzymes in results
- Could influence some markers
- Ask your doctor specifically
- Generally best to avoid

### Procedure Preparation

**Best Practice:**
- Disclose CBD use
- Follow specific instructions
- When in doubt, don't take it

## When to Avoid CBD During Fasting

### Definitely Avoid If

- Medical professional says to fast
- Before surgery or procedures
- Before specific blood tests
- Religious requirements prohibit it
- Unsure about compatibility

### Generally Safe If

- Intermittent fasting for wellness
- Using pure CBD oil
- Minimal carrier oil amounts
- No medical restrictions

## My Take

For intermittent fasting and wellness purposes, CBD oil is unlikely to meaningfully break your fast. The minimal calories from carrier oil don't trigger significant insulin response or prevent autophagy. If you're concerned, simply take CBD during your eating window. For medical fasts, always follow your healthcare provider's instructions—the rules are stricter, and CBD should typically be avoided. Don't overthink wellness fasting with CBD; do be cautious with medical fasting.
