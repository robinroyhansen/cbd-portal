## Key Takeaways

1. **Moving stress** is legitimately intense
2. **Multi-phase support**: before, during, after
3. **Sleep support** critical in new environment
4. **Topical CBD** for physical demands
5. **Keep CBD accessible** during move

---

## My Take

Moving combines almost every type of stress—emotional, physical, logistical, financial. CBD won't make moving easy, but it can help manage the anxiety and physical demands that make it so overwhelming.

The adjustment period after moving is often underestimated. Your body and mind need time to adapt to a new environment. CBD's sleep support can be particularly valuable when you're exhausted but can't relax in an unfamiliar space.
