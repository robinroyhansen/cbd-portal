## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD may help** through anti-inflammatory effects
2. **Topical application** to heel and arch
3. **Combine with** stretching and proper footwear
4. **Addresses symptoms** not the root cause alone
5. **Persistent cases** need professional evaluation

## My Take

Plantar fasciitis is incredibly frustrating—that morning heel pain can be severe. CBD topicals applied to the heel and arch may provide some relief through anti-inflammatory action.

But CBD alone won't fix plantar fasciitis. You need the combination: proper stretching (especially calf stretches), supportive footwear, and sometimes orthotics. Use CBD as one helpful tool alongside these fundamentals.
