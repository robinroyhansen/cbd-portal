## Quick Answer

CBL (Cannabicyclol) is a rare, non-psychoactive [cannabinoid](/glossary/cannabinoid) formed when [CBC](/glossary/cbc) (Cannabichromene) is exposed to light and heat over time. It's a degradation product rather than a primary cannabinoid. Research on CBL is limited, but it does not appear to produce any high or significant psychoactive effects.

## What is CBL?

Cannabicyclol (CBL) is a minor cannabinoid found in aged cannabis and hemp. It doesn't form directly in the plant but develops when CBC breaks down through a process called photochemical conversion.

**Key characteristics:**
- Non-psychoactive
- Formed from CBC degradation
- Found in aged cannabis
- Minimal research available
- Low concentrations in most products

## How CBL Forms

CBL formation pathway:

1. Cannabis plant produces CBCA (cannabichromenic acid)
2. Heat converts CBCA to CBC
3. Light and oxygen convert CBC to CBL over time

This is why CBL is primarily found in older cannabis samples or improperly stored products.

## Potential Properties

While research is extremely limited, early studies suggest CBL may:
- Be non-intoxicating
- Have weak cannabinoid receptor activity
- Possibly have anti-inflammatory properties (theoretical)

However, these are preliminary observations, not established facts.

## CBL in CBD Products

Fresh CBD products typically contain little to no CBL. Its presence may indicate:
- Aged product
- Light exposure during storage
- CBC degradation

Well-manufactured CBD products stored properly should have minimal CBL.
