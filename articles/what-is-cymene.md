## Quick Answer

Para-cymene (p-cymene) is a [terpene](/knowledge/what-are-terpenes) with a mild, citrusy, woody aroma reminiscent of thyme and cumin. A precursor to other terpenes like thymol, cymene research suggests anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antimicrobial properties. It's found in thyme, cumin, and oregano, and occasionally appears in cannabis terpene profiles.

## My Take

Cymene isn't a headline terpene, but the opioid-sparing research catches my attention. As the cannabis/CBD industry increasingly intersects with pain management discussions, terpenes like cymene that may enhance analgesic effects deserve more attention. It's another example of how minor components in full-spectrum products may contribute to overall efficacy.
