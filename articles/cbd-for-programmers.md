## Key Takeaways

1. **Calm focus** suits coding work
2. **Lower doses** to stay sharp
3. **Topical for** desk-work strain
4. **Stress management** for industry pressure
5. **Part of** sustainable career approach

---

## My Take

Programming requires a specific kind of focus—patient, sustained attention with calm problem-solving. Anxiety interferes with this badly, making debugging frustrating and complex problems overwhelming. CBD can support the calm clarity that good coding requires.

But the tech industry's culture of overwork and constant availability creates problems CBD can't solve. Use CBD as part of a sustainable approach to your career, not as a way to push through burnout. The goal is a long, healthy career in tech, not just surviving the next sprint.
