## Key Takeaways

1. **Take 1-2 hours** before appointment
2. **Tell your dentist** about CBD use
3. **Moderate doses** for anxiety support
4. **Not substitute** for sedation when needed
5. **Enable care**—don't avoid the dentist

---

## My Take

Dental anxiety is real and shouldn't be dismissed—but it also shouldn't prevent you from getting needed care. CBD can help take the edge off and make appointments more manageable, potentially enabling you to get care you might otherwise avoid.

For routine cleanings and minor procedures, CBD may be enough. For significant procedures or severe phobia, it's probably not sufficient alone—discuss sedation options with your dentist. The goal is getting the dental care you need, whatever support that requires.
