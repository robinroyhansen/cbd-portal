## The Short Answer

Does CBD help with migraines? Based on the 9 studies I have reviewed, the evidence is limited but intriguing. While there are no large randomized controlled trials specifically testing CBD for migraines, some smaller studies and patient surveys suggest cannabinoids may reduce migraine frequency and intensity. The [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) is involved in pain modulation, and some researchers theorize that "endocannabinoid deficiency" may contribute to migraines. However, I cannot recommend CBD as a primary migraine treatment based on current evidence.

## What the Research Shows

### The Best Evidence (Clinical Trials)

Research specifically examining CBD for migraines remains limited. Most evidence comes from observational studies and surveys rather than controlled trials.

Patient surveys consistently report that cannabis users with migraines experience fewer attacks and reduced intensity. However, these self-reports cannot distinguish between placebo effects and true treatment benefits.

Small clinical studies suggest cannabinoids may affect migraine mechanisms, but none have been large or rigorous enough to establish CBD as an effective migraine treatment.

What I find notable: the theoretical "endocannabinoid deficiency" hypothesis for migraines provides biological rationale for cannabinoid research, but remains unproven.

### What Reviews Conclude

Reviews note that while migraine patients frequently use cannabis and report benefits, the research quality is insufficient to draw clinical conclusions. The lack of randomized controlled trials is a significant gap.

Reviews consistently call for more rigorous research, particularly isolating CBD's effects from THC and comparing cannabinoids to established migraine treatments.

### Supporting Evidence

Preclinical research shows the [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) is involved in the neural pathways implicated in migraines. [CB1 receptors](/glossary/cb1-receptor) are present in brain regions that process migraine pain.

Some researchers propose that migraines may involve endocannabinoid deficiency, similar to fibromyalgia. If true, this would support cannabinoid supplementation, but the theory remains speculative.

## Studies Worth Knowing

### Cannabis for Migraine Survey

Observational studies have found that migraine patients using cannabis report reduced attack frequency, sometimes by 40-50%.

**Key finding:** Self-reported reduction in monthly migraine days with cannabis use.

**Sample:** Migraine patients | **Type:** Survey/Observational

**Why it matters:** Consistent patient reports suggest there may be real effects worth studying in controlled trials.

## How CBD Might Help with Migraines

The potential mechanisms linking CBD to migraine relief involve several pathways.

**Pain modulation:** CBD affects multiple pain pathways through the [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system), serotonin receptors, and inflammatory mediators.

**[Anti-inflammatory](/glossary/anti-inflammatory) effects:** Neuroinflammation may play a role in migraines. CBD's anti-inflammatory properties could help address this component.

**Serotonin modulation:** CBD activates [5-HT1A receptors](/glossary/5-ht1a-receptor), the same receptors targeted by triptan medications commonly used for migraines.

**Stress and anxiety reduction:** Stress is a common migraine trigger. CBD's anxiolytic effects may help prevent stress-triggered attacks.

**Sleep regulation:** Poor sleep triggers migraines for many people. CBD may help by improving sleep quality.

## What Dosages Have Been Studied

Dosing research specific to migraines is limited.

**In available studies:**
- CBD doses: 25-200mg daily
- THC:CBD combinations more commonly studied
- Both preventive (daily) and acute (as-needed) dosing explored

**Important considerations:**
- [Bioavailability](/glossary/bioavailability) varies significantly
- No established migraine-specific doses
- Individual response varies widely
- May need to try different delivery methods

Use our [dosage calculator](/tools/dosage-calculator) for general guidance, but migraine dosing lacks the evidence base of other conditions.

## My Take

Having reviewed 9 studies on CBD and migraines — and worked in the CBD industry for over twelve years — here is my honest assessment:

I find the migraine research frustratingly incomplete. Many migraine patients report that CBD or cannabis helps, and the biological mechanisms make sense. But we lack the rigorous trials needed to confirm these reports.

What I can say is that if you have migraines and want to try CBD, the risk is low and some people do report benefit. But I wouldn't recommend abandoning proven migraine treatments for CBD. Consider it as a potential addition to your regimen rather than a replacement.

I am hopeful that the theoretical interest in "endocannabinoid deficiency" will drive more research. If future trials confirm that cannabinoids help migraines, it could offer a valuable option for the many patients who don't respond adequately to current treatments.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can CBD prevent migraines?

Some patients report reduced migraine frequency with regular CBD use, but clinical trials have not confirmed this. If you want to try CBD preventively, consistent daily dosing would be the approach, but evidence is insufficient to predict results.

### Does CBD help during a migraine attack?

Some users report that CBD helps manage acute migraine pain, though evidence is anecdotal. Fast-acting delivery methods (sublingual, inhaled) would theoretically work best for acute attacks.

### How much CBD should I try for migraines?

There's no established dose. Surveys suggest migraine patients use 25-200mg daily. Start low (25-50mg) and increase gradually while tracking your migraine frequency.

### Can CBD interact with migraine medications?

Yes. CBD can interact with triptans and other migraine medications through the [CYP450](/glossary/cyp450) enzyme system. Consult your healthcare provider before combining CBD with migraine medications.
