## Key Takeaways

5. **Know your response** completely

## My Take

Test anxiety is frustrating because you know the material but anxiety interferes. CBD may help bridge that gap—reducing the anxiety interference so your actual knowledge can show through.

The absolute rule: know exactly how CBD affects you before any important exam. Practice during study sessions, find your optimal dose, and don't experiment on test day.
