## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD doesn't create creativity**

5. **Not a replacement** for creative fundamentals

## My Take

If you're hoping CBD will make you more creative, you'll likely be disappointed. Creativity comes from practice, knowledge, and doing the work. CBD can't provide that.

What CBD may do is reduce the anxiety and self-doubt that get in the way. Many creative people struggle with starting, with self-criticism, with fear of failure. If CBD helps with those blocks, it indirectly supports the creative process.
