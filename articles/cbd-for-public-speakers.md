## My Take

Public speaking anxiety is incredibly common—even experienced speakers deal with it. CBD can help take the edge off, reducing the physical symptoms that can undermine an otherwise well-prepared presentation.

The key is testing beforehand. You need to know exactly how CBD affects you before relying on it for an important speech. And remember: CBD handles the anxiety; you still have to know your material.
