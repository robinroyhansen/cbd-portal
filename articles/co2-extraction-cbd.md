## Quick Summary

CO2 extraction is considered the gold standard for producing clean, pure CBD. Using pressurised carbon dioxide, this method extracts cannabinoids without leaving toxic residues. While more expensive, it produces safer products with better terpene preservation when done correctly.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Uses supercritical CO2 (pressurised) as extraction solvent
- Leaves no harmful residues in final product
- Can be tuned to preserve specific compounds
- More expensive but produces premium extracts
- Environmentally friendly process

## How CO2 Extraction Works

### The Supercritical State

CO2 becomes supercritical at specific temperature and pressure:
- **Critical point:** 31.1°C and 73.8 bar
- Behaves like both liquid and gas
- Excellent solvent properties
- Can be precisely controlled

### The Process

1. **Pressurisation** — CO2 heated and pressurised to supercritical state
2. **Extraction** — Passes through hemp material in extraction vessel
3. **Dissolution** — Cannabinoids, terpenes dissolve into CO2
4. **Separation** — Pressure/temperature changed to release compounds
5. **Collection** — Extract collected, CO2 recycled

### Temperature Variables

- **Subcritical (lower temp)** — Better terpene preservation, lower yields
- **Supercritical (higher temp)** — Higher yields, may damage terpenes
- **Multiple passes** — Can optimise for different compounds

## Advantages of CO2 Extraction

### Purity

- No toxic solvent residues
- Cleanest possible extract
- No need for extensive purification
- Safe for consumption

### Tunability

- Temperature/pressure adjustments target specific compounds
- Can preserve or exclude terpenes
- Selective extraction possible
- Consistent results

### Environmental Benefits

- CO2 is non-toxic
- Can be recycled and reused
- No chemical disposal concerns
- Sustainable process

## Disadvantages

### Cost

- Expensive equipment ($50,000-$500,000+)
- Higher operating costs
- Requires trained technicians
- Longer processing time

### Complexity

- Requires expertise to optimise
- Multiple variables to control
- Not suitable for small operations

## Identifying CO2-Extracted Products

### What to Look For

- "CO2 extracted" on label
- Clean, clear appearance
- Full terpene profile (if subcritical)
- Premium price point

### Quality Verification

Even CO2 extraction requires testing for:
- Cannabinoid content verification
- Microbial contamination
- Heavy metals (from plant material)

---

## My Take

CO2 extraction deserves its reputation as the premium method. The cleanliness and tunability are genuine advantages. However, the method alone doesn't guarantee quality—testing still matters. I prefer CO2-extracted products when available, but a well-made ethanol extract with clean test results is also acceptable.
