## My Take

Marketing regulations exist because the CBD market has attracted bad actors making outrageous claims. Legitimate companies focus on product quality, testing, and transparency—not miracle cures. When evaluating CBD products, treat excessive marketing claims as a warning sign. Companies confident in their products don't need to promise miracles.
