## Key Takeaways

1. **Alcohol withdrawal** needs medical supervision
2. **CBD not for** acute withdrawal
3. **May help** recovery phase
4. **Complete detox first**
5. **Work with** treatment professionals

## My Take

I want to be very clear: alcohol withdrawal can kill. Seizures, delirium tremens—these are medical emergencies. CBD cannot safely substitute for proper medical detox.

Where CBD might help is the recovery phase after acute withdrawal is over. Anxiety, sleep problems, and stress are common in early sobriety, and CBD may support these. But always start with proper medical care for alcohol withdrawal.
