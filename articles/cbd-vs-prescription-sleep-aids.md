## Quick Summary

CBD and prescription sleep medications work differently and have different risk profiles. Prescriptions like zolpidem (Ambien) and benzodiazepines are stronger but carry more risks.

## My Take

For mild sleep issues or anxiety-related insomnia, CBD is a reasonable option to try before escalating to prescriptions. It works differently—creating conditions for sleep rather than forcing it—and has a much better safety profile.

For serious insomnia significantly affecting your life, prescription medications exist for a reason. Work with your doctor. CBD might be part of the solution, but don't avoid needed treatment because you prefer "natural" options.
