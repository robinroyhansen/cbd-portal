## Key Takeaways

## My Take

A good return policy tells you something about a company's confidence in their product. Brands offering satisfaction guarantees are essentially saying "we believe this will work for you."

That said, CBD is subjective—what works for one person may not work for another. That's why I recommend starting with smaller sizes from reputable brands. It's easier than dealing with returns.
