- Not intoxicating
- Not addictive
- Not a cure for diseases

## Starting CBD: Step by Step

### Step 1: Choose Your Product Type

**For beginners, I recommend CBD oil:**
- Flexible dosing (easy to adjust)
- Easy to measure
- Widely available
- Good value

**Other options:**
- Capsules (convenient, fixed dose)
- Gummies (enjoyable, fixed dose)
- Topicals (for localized use only)

### Step 2: Choose a Quality Product

**Look for:**
- Third-party lab testing (COA)
- Clear CBD content (mg)
- Reputable brand
- Reasonable price (not too cheap)

**Avoid:**
- Products without lab reports
- Unknown brands
- Unrealistic claims
- Suspiciously cheap options

### Step 3: Determine Your Starting Dose

**Beginner dosing:**
- Start with 10-20mg
- This is a conservative starting point
- Allows you to assess tolerance
- You can always take more later

### Step 4: Take CBD Properly

**For oil/tincture:**
1. Fill dropper to desired amount
2. Place oil under tongue
3. Hold 60-90 seconds
4. Swallow

**For capsules/gummies:**
- Take with water
- Taking with food may help absorption

### Step 5: Observe and Adjust

**First week:**
- Take same dose daily
- Note any effects
- Don't expect dramatic changes

**Week 2-4:**
- Increase dose if needed (add 5-10mg)
- Track response
- Find your optimal dose

## What to Expect

### First Time

**You may notice:**
- Subtle relaxation
- Slight calm
- Possibly nothing obvious

**You won't notice:**
- High or intoxication
- Dramatic immediate effects
- Sedation (at moderate doses)

### Over Time (Days to Weeks)

With consistent use:
- Effects may become more noticeable
- Sleep quality may improve
- Anxiety baseline may lower
- Benefits often build gradually

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Expecting Immediate Dramatic Effects

**The problem:** CBD is subtle for many people
**The fix:** Give it time; track wellness over weeks

### Mistake 2: Starting Too Low

**The problem:** 5mg may not be enough to notice
**The fix:** Start with at least 10-20mg

### Mistake 3: Giving Up Too Soon

**The problem:** Quitting after one week
**The fix:** Give CBD 2-4 weeks of consistent use

### Mistake 4: Buying Cheap Products

**The problem:** May not contain claimed CBD
**The fix:** Choose tested, reputable products

### Mistake 5: Taking Right Before Bed (for Sleep)

**The problem:** Needs time to work
**The fix:** Take 1-2 hours before bed

## Understanding Product Labels

### Key Information

| Label Term | Meaning |
|------------|---------|

| **CBD per serving** | CBD in each dose/dropper |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will CBD show on a drug test?

**Sublingual:** 15-30 minutes
**Edibles:** 30-90 minutes
**Full benefits:** May take weeks

### Can I take too much?

**Unlikely to be dangerous** but unnecessary. High doses may cause unwanted drowsiness. Find your minimum effective dose.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start with CBD oil** — best for beginners (flexible dosing)
2. **Begin at 10-20mg** — conservative but reasonable start
3. **Choose quality products** — third-party tested, reputable brand
4. **Be patient** — benefits may take 2-4 weeks
5. **Track your response** — note what you observe
6. **It's not a high** — expect subtle, not dramatic

---

## My Take

Starting CBD should be simple. Don't overthink it. Get a quality product, start with 10-20mg, take it consistently for a few weeks, and see how you feel.

The most common mistake is expecting too much too fast. CBD is subtle—it's not going to feel like taking a medication that "kicks in." Think of it as supporting your baseline wellness rather than providing an obvious experience.

Give it a fair trial. If after 3-4 weeks at an adequate dose you're not noticing benefit, CBD may not be right for you—and that's okay. It helps many people but not everyone.

Welcome to CBD. I hope it works well for you.
