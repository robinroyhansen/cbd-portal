## Quick Summary

CBD should typically be stopped before surgery due to potential interactions with anaesthesia and surgical medications, effects on bleeding, and impacts on liver enzyme function. Most surgeons recommend stopping CBD at least one to two weeks before any planned procedure. Always disclose CBD use to your surgical team.

## Key Takeaways

- Stop CBD before surgery (1-2 weeks typically)
- Interactions with anaesthesia possible
- Bleeding concerns exist
- Disclose use to surgical team
- Resume only after doctor approval

## Why CBD and Surgery Don't Mix

### Drug Interactions

**Anaesthesia Concerns:**
- CBD affects liver enzymes
- May alter anaesthesia metabolism
- Could affect sedation levels
- Unpredictable interactions possible

**Other Surgical Medications:**
- Pain medications
- Anti-nausea drugs
- Antibiotics
- Post-operative drugs

### Bleeding Considerations

**CBD May:**
- Have mild blood-thinning effects
- Interact with anticoagulants
- Affect platelet function
- Increase bleeding risk

## When to Stop CBD

### General Guidelines

| Procedure Type | Stop CBD |
|----------------|----------|
| Major surgery | 2 weeks before |
| Minor surgery | 1-2 weeks before |
| Dental procedures | 1 week before |
| Colonoscopy/endoscopy | 1 week before |

### Why This Timing?

- CBD clears from system
- Enzyme function normalises
- Drug interactions minimised
- Safer anaesthesia management

## What to Tell Your Surgical Team

### Essential Disclosure

**Inform Them About:**
- That you use CBD
- Products used (oil, gummies, etc.)
- Dosage and frequency
- When you last took it
- How long you've been using it

### Why Honesty Matters

- Affects anaesthesia planning
- Changes medication choices
- Impacts monitoring decisions
- Better outcomes with full information

---

## Emergency Surgery

### When You Can't Plan

**If Surgery Is Urgent:**
- Tell team about recent CBD use
- They can adjust approach
- Monitoring will be enhanced
- Not a reason to delay emergency care

### Important Point

Never avoid emergency treatment because of CBD use—disclosure allows the team to manage safely.

---

## After Surgery

### When to Resume

**Wait Until:**
- Doctor gives approval
- Off post-operative medications
- Wound healing progressing
- Pain medications no longer needed

### Gradual Return

- Start with lower doses
- Monitor for interactions
- Continue communicating with doctor
- Watch for unusual effects

---

## Specific Procedure Considerations

### Dental Surgery

- Stop 1 week before
- Bleeding risk during extractions
- Interaction with local anaesthetics
- Resume after healing

### Cardiac Procedures

- Extended cessation may be needed
- Multiple drug interactions possible
- Extra caution warranted
- Follow cardiologist advice

### Outpatient Procedures

- Still requires stopping
- Even "minor" procedures matter
- Anaesthesia still used
- Same disclosure rules apply

---

## Common Questions

### "But CBD is natural?"

Natural doesn't mean no interactions. Many natural substances affect medications and procedures.

### "What if I forget to stop?"

Tell your surgical team immediately. They can adjust plans or postpone if needed.

### "Can I use CBD for recovery?"

Only after doctor approval and when off other medications that might interact.

## My Take

This is one area where caution clearly wins. The potential interactions between CBD and anaesthesia or surgical medications aren't worth the risk. Stop CBD before surgery as recommended, disclose your use honestly to your surgical team, and resume only when cleared. Your safety during surgery is far more important than any potential benefit from continuing CBD use.
