## My Take

The CBD research landscape is genuinely exciting, but we're still in early stages for many applications. What we know today will likely be refined, expanded, and in some cases corrected by future studies.

This uncertainty isn't a reason to avoid CBD—it's a reason to stay curious and humble. Use what we know now, pay attention to emerging research, and be willing to update your understanding as evidence develops. The future of CBD research will help all of us use it more effectively.
