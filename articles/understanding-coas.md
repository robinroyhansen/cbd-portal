## Quick Summary

A Certificate of Analysis (COA) is a third-party lab report verifying CBD product contents and safety. Learning to read COAs helps you verify CBD content matches labels, check for THC levels, and ensure products are free from contaminants like pesticides and heavy metals.

## Key Takeaways

- COAs verify CBD/THC content and product safety
- Must be from independent third-party labs
- Should match product batch number
- Check cannabinoid profile, contaminants, and terpenes
- No COA = don't buy the product

## What a COA Contains

### Cannabinoid Profile

Shows concentrations of:
- **CBD** — Primary compound, verify it matches label
- **THC** — Must be under legal limit (0.2% EU, 0.3% US)
- **Other cannabinoids** — CBG, CBN, CBC, etc.
- **Total cannabinoids** — Overall potency

### Contaminant Testing

Safety screens for:
- **Pesticides** — Should be ND (not detected)
- **Heavy metals** — Lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium
- **Residual solvents** — From extraction process
- **Microbial** — Bacteria, mould, yeast

### Terpene Profile

Quality COAs include:
- Individual terpene percentages
- Total terpene content
- Helps predict effects

## How to Read a COA

### Step 1: Verify the Lab

Check that lab is:
- Third-party (independent)
- ISO 17025 accredited
- Not affiliated with the brand
- Reputable (research if needed)

### Step 2: Match the Batch

Ensure COA matches your product:
- Batch/lot number should match
- Recent test date
- Correct product name

### Step 3: Check Cannabinoid Content

Verify:
- CBD content matches label (within 10%)
- THC under legal limits
- Spectrum matches claims (full/broad/isolate)

### Step 4: Review Contaminants

All should show:
- "ND" (not detected) or
- Below action limits
- "Pass" designation

## Red Flags

### Warning Signs

Be cautious if:
- No COA available
- COA from in-house lab
- Old test date (>12 months)
- Batch numbers don't match
- Contaminant failures
- CBD content doesn't match label

### Common Problems

Watch for:
- CBD significantly under label claim
- THC over legal limits
- Pesticide detections
- Heavy metal presence
- Missing test categories

## Where to Find COAs

### Common Locations

- QR code on product packaging
- Brand website (search by batch)
- Request directly from company
- In-store (ask retailer)

### If You Can't Find One

- Contact the brand
- Check social media/email
- If unavailable, don't buy

## My Take

I never buy CBD without checking the COA—it's that simple. Fifteen minutes of verification saves you from wasting money on underdosed products or consuming contaminants. Once you've done it a few times, it becomes quick and automatic. A reputable brand makes COAs easy to find; a questionable brand makes excuses.
