## Quick Summary

CBD can support sleep, especially when insomnia has an anxiety component. The key is **proper dosing, timing, and consistency**—combined with good sleep hygiene. CBD won't knock you out like a sedative, but it may help you fall asleep more easily and sleep more restfully.

## How CBD Helps Sleep

### The Mechanisms

CBD may improve sleep by:
- **Reducing anxiety** that prevents sleep
- **Promoting relaxation** without sedation
- **Addressing pain** that disrupts sleep
- **Supporting sleep-wake cycle** regulation

### What It Doesn't Do

- Sedate you like sleeping pills
- Work immediately for everyone
- Fix poor sleep habits
- Overcome major sleep disorders alone

## Dosing for Sleep

### Recommended Approach

| Goal | Starting Dose | May Increase To |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **General sleep support** | 25mg | 50-75mg |
| **Anxiety-related insomnia** | 25-30mg | 60-100mg |
| **Pain affecting sleep** | 30-40mg | 75-100mg |

### Finding Your Dose

1. Start with 25mg
2. Use for 5-7 days consistently
3. If insufficient, increase by 10-15mg
4. Continue adjusting weekly
5. Find minimum effective dose

### The Dose Sweet Spot

Some find:
- Too low = no effect
- Too high = next-day grogginess
- Just right = falls asleep easier, stays asleep

## Timing Matters

### When to Take CBD for Sleep

**1-2 hours before bed is ideal:**
- Allows time for absorption
- Effects peak as you're trying to sleep
- Sublingual: 15-30 min absorption + building effect
- Capsules: Allow more time (30-60 min absorption)

### Timing Chart

| Product Type | When to Take |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Sublingual oil** | 1-1.5 hours before bed |
| **Capsules/edibles** | 1.5-2 hours before bed |
| **Gummies** | 1-2 hours before bed |

## Combining CBD with Sleep Hygiene

### CBD Alone Won't Fix

If your sleep environment is poor, CBD won't overcome:

- Caffeine too late
- Hot, bright, or noisy bedroom
- Stress and worry

- Dark environment

**At bed:**

## Key Takeaways

1. **Timing is crucial** — 1-2 hours before bed
2. **25-75mg typical** for sleep
3. **Consistency matters** — same time nightly
4. **Takes time** — give it 2-4 weeks
5. **Combine with sleep hygiene** — CBD isn't magic
6. **Find your dose** — individual response varies

## My Take

CBD can genuinely help with sleep, particularly if your insomnia has an anxiety component. The calm-mind effect that CBD provides makes falling asleep easier for many people.

The key mistake I see is people taking CBD right before bed and expecting sedative effects. It doesn't work that way. Take it 1-2 hours before, let it build, and let it work alongside your wind-down routine.

Give it a fair trial—2-4 weeks of consistent use at an adequate dose. If after that you're not seeing benefit, it may not be the solution for you, or there may be underlying issues worth investigating.

And please, don't expect CBD to overcome terrible sleep habits. Dark, cool bedroom + consistent schedule + reduced screens + CBD = much better chance of success than CBD alone with chaos.
