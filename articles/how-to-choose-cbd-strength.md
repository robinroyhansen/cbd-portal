## Quick Summary

CBD product strengths vary widely, from 250mg to 5000mg per bottle. Understanding how to interpret these numbers and choose the right strength for your needs prevents waste and ensures effectiveness.

## Understanding CBD Strength Labels

### Total vs Per-Dose

Important distinction:
- Label shows total CBD in bottle
- Per-dose amount is what matters
- Calculate based on serving size
- Don't confuse the two

### Common Strengths

Typical options:
- 250-500mg: Low strength
- 750-1000mg: Medium strength
- 1500-2000mg: High strength
- 2500-5000mg: Extra strength

---

## Calculating Per-Dose Amount

### Tinctures (30ml bottles)

Math:
- 30ml bottle = ~600 drops
- 1ml dropper = ~20 drops
- Divide total mg by 30 for mg/ml
- Example: 1500mg ÷ 30 = 50mg per dropper

### Common Calculations

Quick reference:
- 300mg/30ml = 10mg per dropper
- 600mg/30ml = 20mg per dropper
- 1000mg/30ml = 33mg per dropper
- 1500mg/30ml = 50mg per dropper
- 3000mg/30ml = 100mg per dropper

### Capsules and Gummies

Simpler:
- Strength per unit listed
- Common: 10mg, 25mg, 50mg per piece
- No math required
- Easier dosing

## Choosing Based on Use

### For Beginners

Starting out:
- Low-strength products
- 10-15mg per dose
- Room to increase
- Economical testing

### For General Wellness

Daily support:
- Medium strength
- 20-40mg per dose
- Sustainable routine
- Good value

### For Specific Issues

Targeted use:
- Higher strengths often needed
- 40-60mg+ per dose
- Depends on issue
- May need experimentation

### For Significant Issues

Higher needs:
- High-strength products
- 60-100mg+ per dose
- More economical at high doses
- Consult healthcare provider

## Factors Affecting Needed Strength

### Body Weight

General guideline:
- Lighter: lower doses often sufficient
- Heavier: may need more
- Not exact correlation
- Starting point only

### Condition Severity

Dose relationship:
- Mild issues: lower doses
- Moderate issues: medium doses
- Significant issues: higher doses
- Adjust based on response

### Individual Sensitivity

Personal variation:
- Some very sensitive to CBD
- Others need more
- Genetics play role
- Find your level

### Product Type

Bioavailability varies:
- Sublingual: higher absorption
- Edibles: lower absorption, need more
- Topicals: localized effect
- Vaping: highest absorption

## Starting Protocol

### Step 1: Choose Starting Dose

Begin with:
- 15-25mg per dose
- Lower for sensitivity concerns
- Higher if significant issue
- Consistent timing

### Step 2: Evaluate

Assessment period:
- Use same dose for 1-2 weeks
- Track effects
- Note any changes
- Be patient

### Step 3: Adjust

Based on response:
- Not enough: increase by 5-10mg
- Too strong: decrease
- Just right: maintain
- Gradual changes

### Step 4: Find Optimal

Goal:
- Lowest effective dose
- Consistent results
- Sustainable cost
- Long-term approach

## Cost Considerations

### Price Per Mg

Compare value:
- Higher strength often better value
- Calculate cost per mg
- Example: $60 for 1000mg = $0.06/mg
- Compare across products

### Economy of Higher Strength

Long-term savings:
- Higher strength bottles cost more
- But cost per dose lower
- Better for regular users
- Upfront investment saves money

### When to Choose Lower Strength

Makes sense:
- Just starting out
- Uncertain about CBD
- Very low dose needs
- Budget constraints

---

## Common Mistakes

### Buying Too Low

Problem:
- Run out quickly
- Poor value per mg
- Frequent reordering
- Upgrade to higher strength

### Starting Too High

Problem:
- Can't titrate down easily
- Wasted product
- Excessive initial cost
- Start lower, increase as needed

### Ignoring Per-Dose Math

Problem:
- Comparing bottles not doses
- Misunderstanding strength
- Over or under-dosing
- Do the calculation

## Key Takeaways

1. **Calculate per-dose** amount, not just total
2. **Start lower** strength, increase as needed
3. **Higher strength** often better value long-term
4. **Individual needs** vary significantly
5. **Be patient** finding optimal dose

## My Take

Understanding CBD strength is mostly math—but it's math that matters for your wallet and your results. A 3000mg bottle isn't "better" than a 1000mg bottle; it just has more CBD per dropper.

Start with a medium-strength product that gives you flexibility. You can always take more or less per dose. Once you know your optimal dose, then buy the most economical strength that delivers it.
