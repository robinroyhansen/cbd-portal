## Quick Summary

Start with 10-25mg of CBD per day and adjust based on your response. There's no universal dose—optimal amounts vary by individual, goal, and body weight. The principle is "start low, go slow," increasing gradually until you find what works for you.

## Key Takeaways

- Start with 10-25mg daily
- Increase gradually every 3-7 days
- Track your response
- Individual optimal varies
- More isn't always better

## The "Start Low, Go Slow" Method

### Step-by-Step

1. **Week 1:** Start at low end
2. **Week 2:** Assess—working? Increase if not
3. **Week 3:** Find minimum effective dose
4. **Ongoing:** Maintain at that level

### Increase Increments

- Add 5-10mg at a time
- Wait 3-7 days between increases
- Track response each step
- Stop when effects achieved

## Calculating Your Dose

### Understanding Concentrations

**Example: 1000mg bottle (30ml)**
- Total: 1000mg CBD
- Per ml: ~33mg CBD
- Per drop: ~1.1mg (assuming 30 drops/ml)

### Measuring

- Use dropper markings
- Count drops for precision
- Calculate mg per drop
- Be consistent

## Finding Your Sweet Spot

- No side effects occurring
- Room to increase

### Signs You Need Less

- Wasting product

---

## Timing Considerations

### When to Take

**Morning:**
- Alertness focus
- Lower doses often
- Daytime effects

**Evening:**
- Sleep focus
- Can use higher doses
- Relaxation goal

### Frequency

- Once daily (maintenance)
- Twice daily (more coverage)
- As needed (flexibility)
- Consistency helps

## Factors Affecting Your Dose

### Individual Variables

- Body weight
- Metabolism speed
- Severity of symptoms
- CBD tolerance

## Common Dosing Mistakes

### Avoid These

1. **Starting too high** — Causes side effects
2. **Giving up too soon** — Need time
3. **Not tracking** — Can't optimise
4. **Inconsistent use** — Effects vary
5. **Ignoring response** — Not adjusting

## Dose Ranges in Research

### What Studies Use

| Condition | Study Doses |
|-----------|-------------|
| Anxiety | 300-600mg |
| Sleep | 160mg+ |
| Epilepsy | 10-20mg/kg |

### Consumer Reality

- Study doses often higher
- Consumer doses typically 25-100mg
- Still effective for many
- Individual response matters

---

## Tracking Your Dose

### Keep a Simple Log

- Date and time
- Dose (mg)
- Effects noticed
- Side effects (if any)
- Notes

### Review Weekly

- Look for patterns
- Adjust accordingly
- Find your optimal

## My Take

The right dose is personal—what works for your friend may not work for you. Start around 20mg, give it a fair trial, and adjust based on your actual response. Most people find their sweet spot between 25-75mg daily, but some need more and some need less. Trust the process and your own experience.
