## My Take

Russia is one of the clearest "no" jurisdictions for CBD. There's no ambiguity, no gray area, no exception for hemp-derived products. All cannabinoids are prohibited, period.

If you're planning to travel to Russia and use CBD, you need to plan for a trip without it. Remove every CBD product from your belongings before you go. The consequences of bringing CBD to Russia—even accidentally—can be severe and life-altering.

This isn't like countries with unclear rules where you might get away with it. Russia actively enforces its drug laws, and foreigners receive no special treatment.
