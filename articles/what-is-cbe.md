## Quick Answer

CBE (Cannabielsoin) is a rare, non-psychoactive [cannabinoid](/glossary/cannabinoid) formed when CBD breaks down under certain conditions. It's a metabolite of CBD rather than a cannabinoid the plant produces directly. Research on CBE is extremely limited, and it's not commonly found in CBD products.

## What is CBE?

Cannabielsoin (CBE) is a minor cannabinoid that forms through the oxidation or metabolism of [CBD](/glossary/cannabidiol). Unlike major cannabinoids that the cannabis plant synthesizes directly, CBE is a degradation product.

**Key characteristics:**
- Non-psychoactive
- Formed from CBD breakdown
- Found in aged or oxidized cannabis
- Very little research available
- Not typically present in fresh CBD products

## How CBE Forms

CBE forms through several pathways:

**Oxidation:** When CBD is exposed to air, light, and heat over time, it can convert to CBE.

**Metabolism:** Human and animal metabolism may convert some CBD to CBE.

**Storage conditions:** Poor storage of CBD products may lead to CBE formation.

## Research Status

CBE is one of the least studied cannabinoids. Current research is limited to:
- Basic chemical characterization
- Identification in metabolic studies
- Detection in aged cannabis samples

No significant therapeutic research has been conducted on CBE specifically.

## CBE in CBD Products

Fresh, properly stored CBD products should contain minimal to no CBE. If you're seeing CBE in lab results, it may indicate:
- Aged product
- Poor storage conditions
- Degraded CBD

This is one reason proper storage of CBD products matters.
