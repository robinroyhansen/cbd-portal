## My Take

Many women have shared positive experiences using CBD for PMS symptoms. While we don't have rigorous clinical trials specifically for PMS, the known mechanisms of CBD—anti-inflammatory, pain-modulating, anxiolytic—align well with common PMS symptoms.

I'd suggest a combination approach: oral CBD for systemic effects (mood, overall comfort) plus topical CBD on the lower abdomen for cramps. Starting a few days before expected symptoms may work better than waiting until symptoms are severe.

Every woman's cycle and symptoms are different, so tracking your response over 2-3 cycles helps determine what works for you.
