## My Take

Building a business is a marathon, not a sprint, but startup culture often treats it like a sprint. CBD can help manage the stress, but it's not a substitute for sustainable practices.

The biggest value I see for entrepreneurs is sleep support. Your business depends on your brain working well, and that requires rest. CBD helps protect sleep even when your mind is racing with business problems.
