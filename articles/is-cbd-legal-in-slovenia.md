## My Take

Slovenia's CBD market is small but functional. Ljubljana has some options, and online ordering serves the whole country well.

For such a small country, the market is reasonable—you won't have the variety of Germany, but basics are accessible. EU imports fill gaps that a small domestic market can't support.

If visiting Slovenia, expect limited in-person options outside Ljubljana. Online ordering or bringing what you need makes sense for specific preferences.
