Nerolidol is a [terpene](/knowledge/what-are-terpenes) with a subtle, complex aroma—woody, floral, and slightly citrusy with bark-like undertones. Known for its sedating properties and unique ability to enhance skin penetration, nerolidol may help other compounds absorb better. Research suggests antifungal, antiparasitic, and anticancer potential.

## My Take

Nerolidol is the "enhancer" terpene that I find particularly interesting for topical applications. Its ability to improve skin penetration could make the difference between a CBD cream that works and one that doesn't. When evaluating transdermal CBD products, I consider nerolidol content a positive indicator of thoughtful formulation. The subtle, pleasant aroma is a bonus.
