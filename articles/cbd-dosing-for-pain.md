## Quick Answer

CBD dosing for pain varies significantly by pain type and severity. Research uses doses from **15-600mg daily**. Most people start with **25-50mg** and adjust based on response. Chronic pain often requires consistent daily dosing for 2-4 weeks before full assessment. Topical CBD can be used alongside oral forms for localized pain.

## Pain Type Matters

Different pain responds differently to CBD:

| Pain Type | Evidence | Typical Approach |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| Neuropathic | Moderate | Oral CBD, consistent use |
| Inflammatory (arthritis) | Moderate | Oral + topical |
| Muscle pain | Limited | Topical often sufficient |
| Chronic widespread | Limited | Oral, higher doses |
| Acute injury | Very limited | Topical for localized |

## Starting Protocol

### For Chronic Pain

**Week 1-2:**
- Start: 25-50mg daily
- Split between morning and evening
- Track pain levels (1-10 scale)

**Week 3-4:**
- If no improvement: Increase to 50-75mg
- If mild improvement: Maintain or slight increase
- Continue tracking

**Week 5-6:**
- Adjust as needed up to 100-150mg
- Some studies use 200-300mg for significant pain
- Find minimum effective dose

### For Acute Pain
- CBD less effective for sudden, acute pain
- Consider topical for localized areas
- May supplement other pain management
- Not a replacement for appropriate acute care

---

## Oral vs Topical Dosing

### Oral CBD (Systemic)
**Best for:**
- Widespread pain
- Internal inflammation
- Neuropathic pain
- Conditions affecting multiple areas

**Dosing:**
- Start 25-50mg/day
- Work up as needed
- Split doses (AM/PM) may help
- Consistent daily use important

### Topical CBD (Localized)
**Best for:**
- Joint pain (arthritis)
- Muscle soreness
- Localized inflammation
- Areas you can reach

**Dosing:**
- Apply liberally to affected area
- Massage in thoroughly
- Reapply 2-3 times daily
- Give 20-30 minutes to absorb

### Combined Approach
Many find best results using both:
- Oral for systemic effect
- Topical for targeted relief
- Common for arthritis

## Research-Based Dosing

### Clinical Studies

| Condition | Doses Studied | Findings |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Neuropathic pain | 50-600mg | Variable improvement |
| Arthritis (topical) | Various | Reduced inflammation |
| Chronic pain | 15-300mg | Some improvement noted |
| Cancer pain | Often with THC | Better results with THC |

### Key Insight
CBD alone shows more modest pain effects than CBD+THC combinations. If legal and appropriate, combination products may be more effective.

## By Pain Condition

### Arthritis Pain
- **Oral:** 25-75mg daily
- **Topical:** Apply to joints 2-3x daily
- **Best approach:** Combination
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks for assessment

### Back Pain
- **Oral:** 50-100mg daily
- **Topical:** For localized areas
- **Note:** Address underlying causes
- **Adjunct to:** Physical therapy, exercise

### Neuropathic Pain
- **Oral:** 50-150mg daily
- **Approach:** Consistent daily dosing
- **Timeline:** May take 4-8 weeks
- **Often:** Better response than other pain types

### Fibromyalgia
- **Oral:** 50-150mg daily
- **Full-spectrum:** May work better
- **Note:** Address sleep and mood too
- **Patience:** Can take months

### Migraine
- **Prophylactic:** Daily dosing (25-75mg)
- **Acute:** Limited evidence for attacks
- **Note:** Prevention may be better than treatment

## Timing Considerations

### For 24-Hour Coverage
Split your dose:
- Morning: 50% of daily dose
- Evening: 50% of daily dose
- More consistent pain control

### For Nighttime Pain
- Take larger dose in evening
- May help sleep alongside pain
- Single bedtime dose possible

### Before Activities
- Take 1-2 hours before physical activity
- May help with activity-related pain
- Not proven for performance

---

## Factors Affecting Dose Needs

### You May Need Higher Doses If:
- Larger body size
- More severe pain
- Faster metabolism
- Using CBD isolate

### You May Need Lower Doses If:
- Smaller body size
- Mild pain
- Slower metabolism
- Using full-spectrum

---

## Realistic Expectations

### What CBD Can Do
- Take the edge off chronic pain
- Reduce pain from 7/10 to 4-5/10 (example)
- Improve function and quality of life
- Reduce reliance on other medications (possibly)

### What CBD Can't Do
- Eliminate severe pain completely
- Replace appropriate medical treatment
- Work immediately like NSAIDs
- Fix underlying structural problems

## CBD vs. Conventional Pain Relief

| Aspect | CBD | NSAIDs | Opioids |
|--------|-----|--------|---------|
| Effectiveness | Moderate | Good | Strong |
| Side effects | Mild | GI, kidney risks | Significant |
| Addiction risk | Very low | None | High |
| Long-term use | Generally safe | Risky | Very risky |
| Onset | Hours/days | 30-60 min | Quick |

## Signs You Need to Adjust

### Dose Too Low
- No change in pain levels
- No side effects either
- After 2-3 weeks of consistent use

### Dose Working
- Pain noticeably reduced
- Function improved
- Manageable or no side effects

### Dose Too High
- Excessive drowsiness
- GI upset
- No additional benefit over lower dose
- Cost becomes unsustainable

## My Practical Advice

1. **Be patient.** Pain relief with CBD builds over time. Single doses rarely show dramatic effects.

2. **Use both oral and topical** for localized conditions like arthritis.

3. **Track your pain levels.** Memory is unreliable; data helps.

4. **Don't abandon proven treatments** for CBD alone. Integration often works best.

5. **Higher doses aren't always better.** Find your minimum effective dose.

6. **Consider full-spectrum** for pain—terpenes and minor cannabinoids may help.

## When to Seek Medical Help

Pain that needs professional evaluation:
- Sudden, severe pain
- Pain with numbness, weakness
- Pain after injury
- Pain interfering with daily function
- Pain not responding to any intervention

CBD is a supplement, not emergency medicine.
