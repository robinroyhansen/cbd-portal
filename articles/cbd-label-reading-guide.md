## Quick Summary

CBD labels can be confusing—terms vary, numbers mislead, and important information is often buried. Learning to read labels properly helps you understand what you're actually buying and compare products accurately.

---

## Why Label Reading Matters

### Common Problems

What you'll encounter:
- Misleading potency claims
- Confusing mg numbers
- Missing information
- Marketing vs. reality

### What You Need to Know

Essential information:
- Actual CBD content
- Per-serving amount
- Spectrum type
- Third-party testing
- Ingredients

---

## Understanding CBD Amounts

### Total vs Per-Serving

Critical distinction:
- "1000mg" usually means total bottle
- Per-serving is what matters
- Calculate dose per use
- Don't compare totals

### Calculating Per-Serving

Math:
- Total mg ÷ servings = mg per serving
- 1000mg ÷ 30ml = ~33mg per dropper
- 750mg ÷ 30 gummies = 25mg per gummy
- Always check serving size

### Common Mislabeling

Watch for:
- "Hemp extract" mg vs CBD mg
- Total cannabinoids vs CBD alone
- Inflated numbers
- Unclear per-serving amounts

---

## Spectrum Types on Labels

### Full-Spectrum

Should contain:
- CBD plus other cannabinoids
- Terpenes
- Trace THC (<0.3%)
- "Whole plant" often used

### Broad-Spectrum

Should contain:
- CBD plus other cannabinoids
- No THC (or non-detectable)
- Terpenes preserved
- "THC-free" claim

### CBD Isolate

Should contain:
- Pure CBD only
- 99%+ CBD
- No other cannabinoids
- No THC

### Verifying Claims

Important:
- Labels don't guarantee truth
- COA should confirm spectrum
- Check actual cannabinoid content
- Some mislabeled

## Ingredient Lists

### What to Look For

Key ingredients:
- CBD or hemp extract amount
- Carrier oil type (MCT, hemp seed, etc.)
- Additional ingredients
- Allergen information

### Red Flags

Concerning signs:
- No ingredient list
- Vague "proprietary blend"
- Unexpected additives
- No carrier oil specified

### Common Carrier Oils

Options:
- MCT oil (common, good absorption)
- Hemp seed oil (different from CBD)
- Olive oil
- Coconut oil

---

## Third-Party Testing Claims

### What to Look For

Verification:
- "Third-party tested" statement
- QR code to COA
- Batch number
- Lab name

### Accessing COAs

How to verify:
- Scan QR code
- Visit website
- Request from company
- Should be freely available

### What COA Should Show

Required information:
- CBD amount (matches label?)
- THC level (within limits?)
- Contaminant testing
- Recent date

---

## Serving Size Information

### Standard Information

Should include:
- Serving size (dropper, capsule, gummy)
- Servings per container
- Suggested use
- CBD per serving

### Dropper Servings

Tinctures typically:
- Full dropper = 1ml
- Partial droppers less precise
- Count drops for accuracy
- Check specific product

---

## Supplement Facts Panel

### What's Required

Standard elements:
- Serving size
- Amount per serving
- % Daily Value (often N/A for CBD)
- Other ingredients

### What It Tells You

Information:
- Actual CBD per dose
- Other active ingredients
- Filler ingredients
- Caloric content (edibles)

---

## Marketing Claims to Ignore

### Unsubstantiated Claims

Ignore:
- "Medical grade"
- "Pharmaceutical quality"
- "Most potent"
- "Best absorption"
- Disease claims

### What Actually Matters

Focus on:
- Actual CBD content
- Third-party testing
- Ingredient quality
- Company reputation

---

## Comparing Products

### Apples to Apples

Compare:
- Per-serving mg (not total)
- Same spectrum type
- Same delivery method
- Verified by COA

### Price Calculation

True cost:
- Price ÷ total mg = cost per mg
- But also consider quality
- COA verification essential
- Cheapest not always best

---

## Red Flags

### Warning Signs

Avoid if:
- No CBD amount listed
- No third-party testing
- Can't find COA
- "Hemp oil" without CBD specification
- Disease treatment claims

### Quality Indicators

Good signs:
- Clear mg labeling
- Accessible COA
- Batch-specific testing
- Transparent company

## Key Takeaways

1. **Total mg** isn't per-serving—calculate it
2. **Spectrum type** affects what you get
3. **COA verification** essential
4. **Compare per-mg** cost accurately
5. **Red flags** indicate poor quality

---

## My Take

Learning to read CBD labels takes the mystery out of shopping. Once you understand the difference between total and per-serving amounts, and how to verify claims with COAs, you can make informed decisions instead of trusting marketing.

The single most important skill is calculating per-serving amounts and verifying them with a COA. A product labeled "1000mg" might have 33mg per serving or 10mg—the label presentation varies wildly. Do the math, check the COA, and you'll know exactly what you're buying.
