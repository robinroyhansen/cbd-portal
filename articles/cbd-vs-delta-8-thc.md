## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD is non-intoxicating**; Delta-8 causes mild high
2. **CBD is legal**; Delta-8 is gray area
3. **CBD won't fail** drug tests (usually); Delta-8 will
4. **CBD is well-studied**; Delta-8 less so
5. **Different purposes**—not interchangeable

---

## My Take

CBD and Delta-8 serve different purposes and shouldn't be confused. CBD is for wellness support without intoxication—you can use it daily and maintain normal function. Delta-8 is a psychoactive substance that will get you high, just milder than regular THC.

If you want the therapeutic benefits of cannabinoids without the high, CBD is your choice. If you want intoxication, that's a different decision entirely—and Delta-8's legal uncertainty and quality concerns make it a riskier choice than legal cannabis where available.
