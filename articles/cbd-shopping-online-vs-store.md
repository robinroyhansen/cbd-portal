## Key Takeaways

1. **Online offers** better selection and prices
2. **In-store provides** immediate access and guidance
3. **Quality verification** essential either way
4. **Price varies** significantly—compare carefully
5. **Staff knowledge** ranges widely

---

## My Take

For most informed consumers, online shopping offers better value—more selection, better prices, and easier access to quality verification like COAs. But there's nothing wrong with in-store purchases if you find a knowledgeable retailer.

The key either way is quality verification. Don't assume a product is good because it's expensive, sold in a nice store, or has fancy packaging. Check the COA, verify the company's reputation, and make informed decisions regardless of where you buy.
