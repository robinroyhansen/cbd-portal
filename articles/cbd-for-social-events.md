## CBD vs Alcohol for Social Anxiety

- "Liquid courage" concept
- But impairment follows
- And next-day consequences

### CBD Alternative

- No hangover
- Stay sharp
- Healthier option

### Combining Both

If drinking:
- CBD may intensify alcohol
- Use lower doses of both
- Know your response

## For Different Personalities

### Introverts

Specific support:

- Overwhelm management
- Recharge breaks still needed
- Easier presence

### Social Anxiety Sufferers

More significant benefit:
- Reduces avoidance urge
- Helps you actually attend
- Supports participation
- May need higher doses

### Those Who "Don't Like Parties"

Reality check:
- CBD won't make you love parties
- But can make them bearable
- Reduces suffering while there
- Enables attendance for obligations

---

## What CBD Won't Do

### Realistic Expectations

CBD doesn't:
- Make you extroverted
- Eliminate all awkwardness
- Create social skills
- Make parties fun if you hate them
- Replace genuine connection effort

### Still Required

For social success:
- Showing up
- Making effort
- Being present
- Listening to others
- Genuine engagement

---

## Practical Tips

### At the Event

Strategies:
- Arrive with CBD already working
- Have an exit plan if needed
- Take breaks if overwhelmed
- Focus on quality conversations

### Know Your Limits

Self-awareness:
- CBD helps, doesn't transform
- Know when to leave
- Don't force yourself beyond tolerance
- Protect your wellbeing

## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD reduces** social anxiety symptoms
2. **Better than alcohol** for staying sharp
3. **Take 1-2 hours** before events
4. **Different events** need different approaches
5. **Won't transform** you, just supports you

---

## My Take

Social events can be genuinely difficult for many people, and there's nothing wrong with using tools to make them easier. CBD offers a way to reduce anxiety without the impairment and consequences of alcohol.

But CBD helps you be a calmer version of yourself, not someone different. If you fundamentally don't enjoy social events, CBD will make them more bearable, not enjoyable. That's valuable—we often have to attend things we'd rather skip. CBD just makes the experience less unpleasant.
