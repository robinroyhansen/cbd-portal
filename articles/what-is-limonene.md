Found abundantly in citrus peels, limonene research suggests potential mood-elevating, anti-anxiety, and anti-inflammatory effects. It's generally associated with uplifting, energizing cannabis experiences.

## My Take

Limonene-dominant CBD products are my go-to for daytime use. The uplifting quality complements CBD without sedation, and the fresh citrus taste is genuinely enjoyable. If you're looking for a CBD product that won't make you sleepy, checking for higher limonene content in the COA is worthwhile.
