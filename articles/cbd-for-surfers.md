## Key Takeaways

1. **Shoulder recovery** from paddling
2. **Skin care** for ocean exposure
3. **Relaxed mental state** for surfing
4. **Post-surf timing** works best
5. **Aligns with** surf lifestyle

## My Take

Surfing and CBD seem like a natural pairing—there's an alignment between the surf lifestyle and CBD's wellness focus. Beyond the cultural fit, CBD can genuinely help with the physical demands of surfing, particularly shoulder recovery from all that paddling.

The skin care aspect is underrated. Sun, salt, and water take a toll, and CBD topicals can be part of a good post-surf skin routine.
