## My Take

Photography is uniquely demanding—it combines artistic pressure with physical strain and client expectations. CBD can help on multiple fronts: managing shoot-day nerves, supporting the physical demands of the work, and aiding recovery afterward. The key is keeping doses moderate during active work while allowing higher doses for recovery. And don't underestimate topicals for the physical toll that carrying gear and holding positions takes on your body.
