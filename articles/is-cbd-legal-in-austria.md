## My Take

Austria offers a good CBD market, particularly in Vienna where you'll find numerous specialized shops. The 0.3% THC limit provides slightly more flexibility than the 0.2% standard in some neighboring countries.

The CBD flower situation has been more complicated than oils and other products, so if that's your preference, check current availability. For oils, capsules, and topicals, you'll have plenty of quality options.

Austrian consumers tend to value quality, and this shows in the products available. Stick to established shops and brands with proper testing, and you'll find good options.
