## My Take

Veterans deserve access to tools that help with service-related challenges. CBD offers a non-intoxicating option that many find genuinely helpful for common concerns like chronic pain, anxiety, and sleep problems.

The key is using CBD as part of a comprehensive approach, not instead of professional treatment. If you're dealing with PTSD or serious mental health concerns, CBD can be supportive but shouldn't replace therapy and proper care.

Talk to your VA provider about CBD. They may have useful insights, and including it in your medical record helps ensure safe, coordinated care.
