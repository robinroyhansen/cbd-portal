## My Take

Financial advisors carry significant responsibility—clients trust them with their life savings, retirement dreams, and financial security. That responsibility creates stress that's amplified during market volatility when clients are most anxious.

CBD can help you maintain the calm, steady presence clients need, especially during turbulent times. Your ability to be calm when they're panicking is valuable—and it's hard to provide that when you're anxious yourself. CBD supports the composure that builds client trust and enables better advice.
