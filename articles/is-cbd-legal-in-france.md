## Quick Answer

CBD is **legal in France** following a landmark ruling, but with specific conditions. Products must be derived from EU-approved hemp varieties, contain less than 0.3% THC (updated from 0.2%), and cannot make therapeutic claims. CBD flowers were banned, then legalized after court challenges—the market has evolved significantly.
