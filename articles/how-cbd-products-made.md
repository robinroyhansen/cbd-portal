## Quick Summary

CBD products go through multiple stages from hemp cultivation to finished products. Understanding this process—growing, harvesting, extraction, refinement, and formulation—helps you evaluate quality and understand why products vary in price and effectiveness.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Process: cultivation → harvesting → extraction → refinement → formulation
- Each stage affects final product quality
- Extraction method impacts purity and compound retention
- Quality testing should occur at multiple stages
- Shortcuts at any stage compromise final product

---

## Stage 1: Cultivation

### Growing Hemp

Quality starts with:
- High-CBD seed genetics
- Clean soil (tested for contaminants)
- Proper growing conditions
- Organic practices (ideal)
- Compliance with regulations

### Factors Affecting Quality

- Seed genetics determine cannabinoid profile
- Soil contamination transfers to plant
- Growing practices affect terpenes
- Timing of harvest impacts potency

---

## Stage 2: Harvesting

### When to Harvest

Optimal timing matters:
- Peak cannabinoid content
- Desired terpene profile
- Before THC increases
- Weather considerations

### Drying and Curing

Post-harvest processing:
- Proper drying preserves compounds
- Curing develops terpene profile
- Moisture levels matter (mould prevention)
- Storage conditions important

---

## Stage 3: Extraction

### Common Methods

- **CO2 Extraction** — Premium, clean, selective
- **Ethanol Extraction** — Efficient, scalable
- **Hydrocarbon** — Effective but requires purging
- **Solventless** — Clean but less efficient

### What Comes Out

Raw extract contains:
- Cannabinoids (CBD, trace THC, others)
- Terpenes
- Waxes and fats
- Chlorophyll
- Other plant compounds

---

## Stage 4: Refinement

### Common Processes

- **Winterisation** — Removes fats and waxes
- **Filtration** — Removes particulates
- **Distillation** — Concentrates cannabinoids
- **Chromatography** — Isolates specific compounds

### Spectrum Creation

Processing determines spectrum:
- **Full-spectrum** — Minimal refinement, keeps THC
- **Broad-spectrum** — THC removed, others retained
- **Isolate** — Pure CBD (99%+)

---

## Stage 5: Formulation

### Product Types

Extract becomes:
- **Oils/tinctures** — CBD + carrier oil
- **Capsules** — CBD in soft/hard gel
- **Gummies** — CBD in edible matrix
- **Topicals** — CBD in cream/balm base
- **Vapes** — CBD in vaporisable form

### Formulation Matters

Quality formulation includes:
- Proper carrier oils
- Stable emulsions
- Accurate dosing
- Appropriate additives
- Shelf stability

---

## Quality Control

### Testing Points

Should occur at:
- Raw hemp (before extraction)
- After extraction
- After refinement
- Final product

### What's Tested

- Cannabinoid content
- Contaminants
- Potency accuracy
- Stability

---

## My Take

Understanding production helps you evaluate products. Cheap CBD often means shortcuts somewhere—poor hemp, inadequate extraction, minimal testing. Quality takes time and costs money. When products seem too cheap, something was compromised. The production chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
