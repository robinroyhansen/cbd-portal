## Quick Summary

CBD is extracted from hemp using methods including CO2 extraction, ethanol extraction, and hydrocarbon extraction. CO2 extraction is considered the gold standard for purity and safety. The extraction method affects the final product's cannabinoid and terpene profile. After extraction, crude CBD is refined into distillate or isolate through additional processing steps.

## The Extraction Goal

**Starting material:** Hemp biomass (flowers, leaves)
**Target:** Extract cannabinoids and terpenes
**Challenge:** Remove chlorophyll, waxes, and unwanted compounds
**Result:** CBD-rich extract for products

## CO2 Extraction (Supercritical)

### How It Works
1. CO2 is pressurized and heated past its "critical point"
2. Supercritical CO2 acts as solvent
3. Passes through hemp material
4. Dissolves cannabinoids and terpenes
5. Pressure reduced; CO2 evaporates
6. CBD extract remains

### Advantages
- No residual solvents
- Precise temperature control
- Preserves terpenes (with proper parameters)
- Environmentally friendly (CO2 recyclable)
- Considered safest method

### Disadvantages
- High equipment cost
- Complex operation
- Requires expertise
- Slower than some methods

### Parameters Matter
| Parameter | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Pressure | Higher = more extraction |
| Temperature | Affects which compounds extract |
| Time | Longer = more complete extraction |
| CO2 flow rate | Affects efficiency |

## Ethanol Extraction

### How It Works
1. Hemp soaked in food-grade ethanol
2. Ethanol dissolves cannabinoids
3. Solution filtered
4. Ethanol evaporated (recovered)
5. Crude extract remains

### Advantages
- Efficient at scale
- Lower equipment cost
- Well-understood process
- GRAS solvent (food-grade)

### Disadvantages
- May extract chlorophyll (unless cold)
- Requires complete solvent removal
- Less selective than CO2
- Fire/explosion risk with solvent

### Temperature Variations
- **Warm ethanol:** Faster but extracts more chlorophyll
- **Cold ethanol (cryo):** Cleaner, fewer unwanted compounds
- **Room temperature:** Balance of speed and quality

## Hydrocarbon Extraction

### Common Solvents
- Butane (BHO - Butane Hash Oil)
- Propane
- Pentane
- Hexane

### How It Works
1. Solvent passes through hemp
2. Dissolves cannabinoids quickly
3. Solvent purged through vacuum/heat
4. Concentrate remains

### Advantages
- Very efficient
- Preserves terpenes well
- Fast processing
- Good for concentrates

### Disadvantages
- Safety concerns (flammable)
- Residual solvent risk
- Requires thorough purging
- Regulatory scrutiny

### Residual Solvent Testing
Labs test for residual solvents:
- Butane: <5,000 ppm typically acceptable
- Quality products: Much lower
- COA should show residual solvent results

## Other Extraction Methods

### Olive Oil Extraction
- Simple, safe
- Not efficient for commercial scale
- Used for homemade products
- No solvent concerns

### Steam Distillation
- Traditional essential oil method
- Less efficient for cannabinoids
- Can degrade some compounds
- Rarely used for CBD

### Lipid Extraction
- Uses fats/oils as solvent
- Gentle process
- Limited commercial use
- Simple equipment

## Post-Extraction Processing

### Crude Extract → Distillate

**Winterization:**
- Mix crude with ethanol
- Freeze overnight
- Filter out waxes and lipids
- Evaporate ethanol

**Decarboxylation:**
- Heat treatment
- Converts CBDa to CBD
- Activates cannabinoids
- Temperature/time critical

**Distillation:**
- Short-path or wiped-film distillation
- Separates compounds by boiling point
- Produces 80-90% CBD distillate
- Removes remaining impurities

### Distillate → Isolate

**Isolation/Crystallization:**
- Further purify distillate
- Precipitate CBD crystals
- Filter and wash
- Results in 99%+ pure CBD

## Product Types by Processing Level

| Product Type | CBD Content | Terpenes | Other Cannabinoids |
|--------------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| Crude Extract | 30-60% | Yes | Yes |
| Distillate | 80-90% | Reduced | Some |
| Broad-Spectrum | 80-90% | Added back | Yes (no THC) |
| Isolate | 99%+ | No | No |
| Full-Spectrum | 40-80% | Yes | Yes (incl. THC) |

## How Extraction Affects Quality

### Terpene Preservation
- High heat destroys terpenes
- CO2 can be tuned for terpene preservation
- Ethanol often removes terpenes
- Many products add terpenes back

### Chlorophyll Content
- Gives green color, grassy taste
- Cold extraction reduces
- Can be removed in post-processing
- Not harmful, just aesthetic/taste

### Cannabinoid Profile
- Extraction method affects ratios
- Temperature affects which compounds extract
- Post-processing can concentrate specific cannabinoids

---

## Quality Indicators

### Good Signs
- CO2 or cold ethanol extraction stated
- Third-party COA available
- Low residual solvents
- Appropriate cannabinoid levels
- Transparent about methods

### Red Flags
- No extraction method disclosed
- No testing available
- Unusually cheap pricing
- Unrealistic claims

---

## My Take

Extraction method matters more than many consumers realize. CO2 extraction has become the industry standard for good reason—it produces clean, consistent extracts without residual solvent concerns. That said, cold ethanol extraction can produce excellent results at lower cost.

What I really look for is transparency and testing. The best extraction in the world means nothing if the final product isn't tested. A company that discloses their method, provides comprehensive COAs, and maintains consistency batch-to-batch is doing extraction right, regardless of specific method.
