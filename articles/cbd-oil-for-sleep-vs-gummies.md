## Quick Summary

For sleep, both CBD oil and gummies can be effective, but gummies may have an edge due to their longer-lasting effects from digestive absorption. Gummies taken 1-2 hours before bed can provide sustained CBD throughout the night. Oil works faster but may not last as long. Many sleep-specific products (both formats) also contain melatonin or other sleep aids.

## Falling Asleep vs. Staying Asleep

### For Falling Asleep

**Oil May Be Better:**
- Faster onset
- Works quickly
- Helps initial relaxation
- Take near bedtime

- Less likely to wear off
- Better through-night

### For Both

**Consider:**

- Or higher-dose oil
- Or combination approach
- Sleep-specific products

---

## Common Sleep Patterns

### Difficulty Falling Asleep

**Best Approach:**

- OR gummies taken earlier
- Focus on pre-sleep timing
- Consistent routine

### Waking During Night

**Best Approach:**
- Gummies for duration
- Take earlier (1-2 hours before)
- Sustained effects through night
- CBD + melatonin may help

### Both Issues

**Best Approach:**
- Gummies with sleep aids
- Proper timing (earlier)
- Consistent dosing
- Track results

## Dosing for Sleep

### General Guidelines

**Starting:**

## Real-World Considerations

### Convenience Winner

**Gummies:**
- Easier routine
- No measuring
- Pleasant experience
- Fits naturally into evening

### Flexibility Winner

**Oil:**
- Adjust dose easily
- Take when needed
- More control
- Better if schedule varies

## My Take

For sleep specifically, I generally recommend gummies or edibles over sublingual oil. The longer duration from digestive absorption is better suited to lasting through the night. The key is taking them 1-2 hours before bed so they're peaking when you want to sleep and lasting into the night. That said, if you have trouble initially falling asleep more than staying asleep, oil's faster onset might suit you better. The ideal might be trying both and seeing which pattern works for your sleep issues.
