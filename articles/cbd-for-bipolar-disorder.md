## Key Takeaways

2. **Don't replace** psychiatric medications
3. **Potential concerns** about mood effects
4. **Only with psychiatrist** approval
5. **Monitor carefully** if trying

## My Take

Bipolar disorder is one condition where I'd urge real caution with CBD. We don't have good evidence it helps, and there are theoretical concerns it could affect mood cycling. The stakes are high—untreated bipolar episodes can be devastating.

If you have bipolar disorder, your mood stabilizers and psychiatric care are essential. Any CBD use should only happen with your psychiatrist's knowledge and approval, with careful monitoring.
