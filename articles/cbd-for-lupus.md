## Key Takeaways

1. **Limited research** on CBD for lupus
2. **Anti-inflammatory** effects may help symptoms
3. **Not a replacement** for lupus treatment
4. **Drug interactions** possible
5. **Work with rheumatologist**

## My Take

Lupus is complex and requires careful medical management. While CBD's anti-inflammatory properties are theoretically relevant, we don't have solid evidence for lupus specifically.

If you want to try CBD, do so as a complement to your prescribed treatment, not a replacement. Keep your rheumatologist informed and watch for any interaction with your medications.
