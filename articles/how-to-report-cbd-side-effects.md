## Quick Summary

If you experience side effects from CBD, you can report them to regulatory authorities (like the MHRA in the UK or FDA in the US), to the product manufacturer, and to your healthcare provider. Reporting helps build safety data, may trigger investigations, and protects other consumers. Even minor side effects are worth reporting.

## My Take

Reporting side effects might seem like a hassle, but it genuinely matters. Regulatory authorities can only identify problems when people report them. Your single report might be the one that triggers an investigation or leads to a recall that protects thousands. Take a few minutes to report—you're helping build the safety data that the CBD industry still lacks.
