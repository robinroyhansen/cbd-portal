## Key Takeaways

1. **Topicals** for targeted physical relief
2. **Evening use** for stress and sleep
3. **Ergonomics** matter more than CBD
4. **Movement breaks** essential
5. **CBD supplements** good habits, doesn't replace

---

## My Take

Desk work is surprisingly hard on the body—the chronic sitting, poor posture, and repetitive motions create real problems over time. CBD can help manage the resulting tension, pain, and stress.

But CBD isn't a fix for a bad setup. Good ergonomics, regular movement, and screen breaks matter more than any supplement. Use CBD to support good habits, not to enable sitting in pain all day without addressing the cause.
