## Quick Summary

Whether CBD breaks your intermittent fast depends on your fasting goals and how strictly you define "fasted." Pure CBD has minimal calories, but carrier oils add some. For most IF practitioners, CBD is acceptable during fasting windows, but strict purists may prefer to wait.

## Does CBD Have Calories?

### CBD Itself

Pure CBD:
- Essentially zero calories
- No carbs or sugar
- Just the compound
- Minimal metabolic impact

### Carrier Oil Calories

The consideration:
- MCT oil: ~8 calories per ml
- Typical serving: 0.5-1ml
- Total: 4-8 calories
- Small but present

## Types of Fasts

### Strict Water Fast

Definition:
- Nothing but water
- Any calories break fast
- CBD oil would break it
- Purist approach

### Modified Fast (Common IF)

Most practitioners:
- Allow minimal calories (<50)
- CBD oil falls under this
- Practical approach
- Little metabolic impact

### Fat-Only Fast

Some IF approaches:
- Allow pure fats
- CBD in MCT fits
- May support ketosis
- Not breaking this fast

## CBD and Fasting Goals

### Weight Loss

Consideration:
- Minimal calories from CBD
- Unlikely to affect results
- Most people fine
- Practical approach

### Autophagy

Debate:
- Strict fasting maximizes autophagy
- Any calories may reduce
- Research unclear
- Personal choice

### Insulin Sensitivity

CBD oil:
- Fat doesn't spike insulin
- Minimal impact
- Most IF benefits preserved
- Generally acceptable

### Gut Rest

If goal is gut rest:
- Any ingestion breaks it
- CBD would be included
- Wait for eating window
- Depends on why you fast

---

## Practical Approaches

### Option 1: Fast Window CBD

Approach:
- Take CBD during fast
- Accept minimal calories
- Most benefits preserved
- Convenient timing

### Option 2: Eating Window Only

Approach:
- CBD with meals
- Fat enhances absorption anyway
- Purist compliance
- Works well

### What Most People Do

Reality:
- Take CBD when convenient
- Don't stress about it
- Minimal impact either way
- Practical approach wins

## CBD Forms and Fasting

### CBD Oil

Consideration:
- Has carrier oil calories
- 4-8 calories typical
- Most IF practitioners accept
- Take with meals if strict

### CBD Capsules

Similar to oil:
- Small amount of filler
- Minimal calories
- Same considerations
- Personal choice

### CBD Isolate Powder

Option:
- Pure CBD, no carrier
- Essentially zero calories
- For strict fasters
- Can add to water (poorly soluble)

## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD oil has minimal calories** (from carrier)
2. **Most IF practitioners** accept CBD during fast
3. **Strict fasters** may prefer eating window
4. **Goals determine approach** — weight loss vs. autophagy
5. **Practical approach** generally fine

---

## My Take

For the vast majority of intermittent fasters, CBD during the fasting window is fine. The 4-8 calories from carrier oil are negligible and won't meaningfully impact your results.

If you're doing a strict water fast for specific reasons, then yes, CBD oil technically breaks it. For standard 16:8 or similar IF approaches, don't overthink it—take CBD when it works for you.
