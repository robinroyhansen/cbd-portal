## Quick Summary

For beginners, a medium-strength CBD oil (500-1000mg per 30ml bottle) offers good flexibility. This allows you to start with lower doses and increase as needed. Higher strengths suit experienced users or those needing higher doses, while lower strengths may be too weak for many goals.

## Key Takeaways

- Medium strength (500-1000mg) best for beginners
- Calculate cost per mg, not just bottle price
- Higher strength = more value usually
- Match strength to expected dose
- Don't buy lowest strength to "start low"

## Understanding CBD Strengths

### How It's Measured

**Bottle Labelling:**
- Total mg in bottle (e.g., 1000mg)
- Concentration (e.g., 3.3%)
- Per-ml amount (e.g., 33mg/ml)

### Common Bottle Sizes

| Bottle Size | Common Strengths |
|-------------|------------------|
| 10ml | 250-1000mg |
| 30ml | 500-3000mg |
| 50ml | 1000-5000mg |

---

## Strength Recommendations

### By Experience Level

| Level | Recommended Strength |
|-------|---------------------|
| Beginner | 500-1000mg (30ml) |
| Intermediate | 1000-1500mg (30ml) |
| Experienced | 1500-3000mg (30ml) |

### By Daily Dose Needs

| Daily Dose | Minimum Bottle Strength |
|------------|------------------------|
| 10-20mg | 300-500mg |
| 25-50mg | 500-1000mg |
| 50-100mg | 1000-2000mg |
| 100mg+ | 2000mg+ |

---

## The Value Calculation

### Cost Per mg

**How to Calculate:**
Bottle Price ÷ Total mg = Cost per mg

**Example:**
- 500mg bottle: £40 = £0.08/mg
- 1000mg bottle: £60 = £0.06/mg
- 2000mg bottle: £100 = £0.05/mg

### Higher Strength = Better Value

- Price doesn't scale linearly
- Larger/stronger usually cheaper per mg
- Worth buying up if you know your dose
- But don't overbuy if testing

---

## Common Mistake: Starting Too Low

### Why 250mg Is Often Wrong

**Problem:**
- Very dilute product
- Need many drops for effect
- Runs out quickly
- Poor value

**Exception:**
- Children (with medical guidance)
- Extremely sensitive individuals
- Very low doses needed

### Better Approach

Start with medium strength, use fewer drops.

---

## Matching Strength to Method

### Oil/Tincture

- All strengths available
- Medium-high best value
- Easy to dose precisely

### Gummies

- Fixed doses per gummy
- Choose based on dose needs
- 10-25mg/gummy common

### Capsules

- Fixed doses
- Match to your needs
- 10-50mg/capsule typical

---

## If You're Unsure

### Safe Starting Strategy

1. **Buy 1000mg (30ml)** — Good middle ground
2. **Start with half dropper** — About 15mg
3. **Adjust based on response**
4. **Know for next purchase**

### First Purchase Tips

- Don't commit to huge bottle
- Medium strength offers flexibility
- Can always buy stronger next time
- Track what works

---

## Upgrading Strength

### When to Go Stronger

- Found your dose, using lots of oil
- Higher concentration more practical
- Better value per mg
- Fewer drops needed

### Benefits of Higher Strength

- More convenient dosing
- Usually better value
- Less frequent purchases
- Less carrier oil consumed

## Quick Reference Guide

### For Common Goals

| Goal | Suggested Strength |
|------|-------------------|
| Trying CBD first time | 500-1000mg |
| Sleep support | 1000mg+ |
| Stress/anxiety | 1000-1500mg |
| Pain management | 1500mg+ |
| General wellness | 500-1000mg |

## My Take

For most people, a 1000mg bottle (30ml) is the sweet spot—strong enough to be effective and economical, but not so concentrated that you're committed to high doses. Calculate the cost per mg rather than looking at bottle prices. If you know you need higher doses, buying stronger saves money.
