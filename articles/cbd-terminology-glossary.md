## Quick Summary

The CBD industry uses specific terminology that can be confusing for newcomers. This glossary explains the most important terms you'll encounter when researching and buying CBD products.

---

## Cannabinoid Terms

### CBD (Cannabidiol)
The main non-psychoactive cannabinoid in hemp. Doesn't cause a "high" and is legal in most places when derived from hemp with <0.3% THC.

### THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol)
The psychoactive cannabinoid that causes intoxication. Legal hemp must contain <0.3% THC.

### CBG (Cannabigerol)
"The mother cannabinoid"—precursor to CBD and THC. Has its own potential benefits.

### CBN (Cannabinol)
Cannabinoid formed when THC ages. Often associated with sedating effects.

### CBC (Cannabichromene)
Non-psychoactive cannabinoid with emerging research on potential benefits.

---

## Product Types

### Full-Spectrum
Contains all cannabinoids from hemp, including trace THC (≤0.3%). Produces "entourage effect."

### Broad-Spectrum
Contains multiple cannabinoids but THC has been removed. Good middle ground.

### CBD Isolate
Pure CBD only (99%+). No other cannabinoids, terpenes, or THC.

### Hemp Extract
General term for extract from hemp plant. May include CBD plus other compounds.

---

## Extraction and Processing

### CO2 Extraction
Clean extraction method using carbon dioxide under pressure. Considered gold standard.

### Ethanol Extraction
Uses food-grade alcohol to extract cannabinoids. Effective and common method.

### Winterization
Process to remove fats and waxes from extract, creating purer oil.

### Distillation
Further refinement of CBD oil to increase purity and concentration.

---

## Measurement Terms

### mg (Milligrams)
Unit of measurement for CBD content. Higher mg = more CBD.

### Bioavailability
Percentage of CBD that actually enters your bloodstream. Varies by delivery method.

### Sublingual
Under the tongue—a delivery method for oils that increases absorption.

### Potency
The strength/concentration of CBD in a product.

---

## Quality and Testing

### COA (Certificate of Analysis)
Lab report showing product contents and safety testing results.

### Third-Party Testing
Independent lab verification (not from the company selling the product).

### Batch/Lot Number
Identifier linking your product to specific lab testing.

### ND (Not Detected)
Lab result showing a compound is below detectable levels.

---

## Plant Terms

### Hemp
Cannabis sativa containing ≤0.3% THC. Legal source of CBD.

### Marijuana
Cannabis containing >0.3% THC. Still federally illegal in the US.

### Terpenes
Aromatic compounds in hemp that may enhance effects. Examples: myrcene, limonene.

### Phytocannabinoids
Cannabinoids naturally occurring in plants (vs. synthetic).

---

## System Terms

### Endocannabinoid System (ECS)
Body system with receptors that interact with cannabinoids. Regulates various functions.

### CB1 Receptors
Cannabinoid receptors mainly in the brain. THC activates these directly.

### CB2 Receptors
Cannabinoid receptors mainly in the immune system and body.

### Entourage Effect
Theory that cannabinoids work better together than in isolation.

---

## Regulatory Terms

### Hemp-Derived
From hemp plants with ≤0.3% THC. Important for legality.

### Farm Bill
2018 US legislation that legalized hemp and hemp-derived CBD.

### GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe)
FDA designation indicating safety (CBD doesn't have this currently).

### Novel Food
EU classification for foods without significant consumption history before 1997. Includes CBD.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Understanding terms** helps you make informed choices
2. **Spectrum types** determine cannabinoid content
3. **COA and third-party testing** are quality markers
4. **Bioavailability** affects how much CBD you actually absorb
5. **Hemp vs marijuana** is the legal distinction

---

## My Take

Don't let terminology intimidate you. Once you understand a few key terms—especially spectrum types, COA, and milligrams—you'll be able to navigate the CBD market confidently.

The most important terms for consumers: full-spectrum vs. broad-spectrum vs. isolate (what's in the product), COA (proof of quality), and mg (how much CBD you're getting).
