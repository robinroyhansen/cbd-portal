## Quick Summary

Yes, CBD can cause dry mouth (cottonmouth) in some people. This happens because cannabinoid receptors are present in salivary glands, and CBD may reduce saliva production. It's a common but mild side effect that's easily managed with hydration.

## Comparing Delivery Methods

### Relative Dry Mouth Risk

|--------|----------------|
| Sublingual oils | Moderate |
| Vaping | Higher |
| Edibles | Lower |
| Capsules | Lower |
| Topicals | None |

### Why Differences

- Direct oral contact increases effect
- Sublingual held in mouth
- Vaping dries tissues
- Swallowed products less direct

## My Take

Dry mouth is one of CBD's most common side effects, but it's also one of the easiest to manage. Keep water handy, and you'll likely barely notice it. If it's particularly bothersome, try a lower dose or different delivery method. It's not a reason to stop using CBD.
