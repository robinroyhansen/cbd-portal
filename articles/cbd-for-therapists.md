## Key Takeaways

1. **Emotional labor** is real and demanding
2. **Recovery use** rather than clinical use
3. **Part of** comprehensive self-care
4. **Not substitute** for supervision/therapy
5. **Sustainable** practice support

---

## My Take

Therapists give constantly—holding others' pain is demanding work that takes a real toll. CBD can support the recovery that makes this work sustainable, helping with the transition out of therapist mode and the sleep that processes the day's emotional content.

But CBD is a small part of the self-care therapists need. Supervision, personal therapy, manageable caseloads, and professional support systems are the foundation. CBD can help at the margins—better sleep, smoother transitions, reduced background stress—but it doesn't fix systemic issues or replace proper professional support.
