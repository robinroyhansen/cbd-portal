## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD may help** with inflammation and nerve symptoms
2. **Topical to wrist** combined with oral
3. **Splinting is key** especially at night
4. **Ergonomics matter** for prevention/management
5. **Seek diagnosis** for proper treatment

---

## My Take

Carpal tunnel can seriously impact work and daily life. CBD might help with the inflammatory component and general discomfort, particularly as a topical applied to the wrist area.

But effective carpal tunnel management requires more: proper ergonomics, wrist splints (especially sleeping in one), and potentially medical treatment. Use CBD as supportive, not sole, therapy.
