## Quick Answer

CBD is **legal in Japan** under specific conditions—it must be derived from hemp stalks or seeds only (not flowers or leaves) and contain **zero THC**. Japan has strict cannabis laws, so compliance is critical. A growing market exists, but with stricter requirements than most Western countries.

## Japan's Unique Regulations

### The Cannabis Control Act

Japan's strict cannabis laws:
- Cannabis (marijuana) strictly prohibited
- Severe penalties for possession
- But CBD from stalks/seeds is exempt
- THC absolutely prohibited (zero tolerance)

### CBD Exception

CBD is permitted when:
- Extracted from stalks or seeds only
- Contains zero THC (not 0.3%, but 0%)
- Properly documented/certified
- No other illegal cannabinoids

## What Makes Japan Different

### Flower/Leaf Prohibition

| Plant Part | CBD Legal? |
|------------|------------|
| Stalks | Yes |
| Seeds | Yes |
| Flowers | **No** |
| Leaves | **No** |

This is unique to Japan—most countries focus on THC content, not plant part.

### Zero THC Requirement

Unlike US (0.3%) or EU (0.2%):
- Japan requires **zero** THC
- Not trace amounts—absolutely none
- Testing must confirm 0.0%
- No full-spectrum products possible

---

## What's Legal

### Permitted Products

- CBD isolate products (verified THC-free)
- CBD from stalk/seed extraction
- Properly documented imports
- Products with certificates of analysis

### Not Permitted

- Full-spectrum CBD (contains THC)
- CBD from flowers/leaves (even if THC-free)
- Any product with detectable THC
- Products without proper documentation

4. **Don't bring foreign CBD** — too risky
5. **Buy domestically** in Japan

## My Take

Japan is a challenging but growing CBD market. The rules are stricter than anywhere in the West—zero THC (not trace amounts) and extraction from stalks/seeds only (not flowers).

For visitors, my strong advice is: don't bring CBD to Japan. The risk is simply not worth it. Japanese cannabis laws are serious, enforcement is real, and your Western CBD product almost certainly doesn't meet Japanese standards.

Instead, if you want CBD in Japan, buy from domestic retailers. Products will be more expensive and limited in variety (no full-spectrum), but they'll be legal and you'll avoid any risk.

Japan is not a place to test legal boundaries regarding cannabis products.
