## Quick Summary

Yes, CBD products can degrade over time, typically lasting 1-2 years when properly stored. Exposure to heat, light, and air accelerates degradation. While expired CBD is unlikely to be harmful, it may lose potency and effectiveness. Proper storage extends shelf life significantly.

## Key Takeaways

- CBD typically lasts 1-2 years
- Degrades with heat, light, and air
- Won't become toxic, just weaker
- Proper storage extends life
- Check expiration dates

## How CBD Degrades

### The Process

**Cannabinoid Breakdown:**
- CBD oxidises over time
- Converts to other compounds
- Potency decreases
- Effectiveness reduces

### Accelerating Factors

- Heat exposure
- Light (especially UV)
- Air/oxygen exposure
- Humidity
- Time

## Typical Shelf Life

### By Product Type

| Product | Shelf Life |
|---------|------------|
| CBD Oil | 12-24 months |
| Gummies | 6-12 months |
| Capsules | 12-24 months |
| Topicals | 12-18 months |
| Vape liquid | 12-18 months |

### Factors Affecting Life

- Product quality
- Packaging quality
- Storage conditions
- Preservatives used

## Signs CBD Has Gone Bad

### Visual Signs

- Colour changes (darkening)
- Cloudiness
- Separation that won't remix
- Crystallisation (not always bad)

### Smell/Taste Signs

- Rancid smell
- Off taste
- Unusual odour
- Carrier oil gone bad

### Effectiveness Signs

- Doesn't work like before
- Need more for same effect
- Feels "weaker"

---

## Is Expired CBD Harmful?

### Generally No

**Expired CBD:**
- Not toxic or dangerous
- Just less effective
- May taste off
- Wasted money more than health risk

### Exceptions

**Could Be Problematic If:**
- Visible mould
- Clearly contaminated
- Rancid carrier oil
- Unusual growth

---

## Proper Storage

### Best Practices

1. **Cool location** — Room temp or below
2. **Dark place** — Away from light
3. **Airtight** — Close caps tightly
4. **Upright** — Prevents leakage
5. **Original container** — Designed for storage

### Avoid

- Window sills
- Near stove/oven
- In bathroom (humidity)
- In car (temperature swings)
- Open containers

---

## Refrigeration

### When to Refrigerate

**Consider For:**
- Long-term storage
- Warm climates
- Bulk purchases
- Extending shelf life

### Notes

- May thicken oil
- Let warm before use
- Condensation can be issue
- Usually not necessary

---

## How to Maximise Shelf Life

### Buying Tips

- Check expiration date
- Buy from high-turnover retailers
- Don't overbuy
- Consider smaller bottles

### Storage Tips

- Store properly immediately
- Use within reasonable time
- Don't leave open
- Keep away from heat

---

## Carrier Oil Consideration

### Carrier Oils Expire Too

**Common Carriers:**
- MCT oil: Stable, long shelf life
- Hemp seed oil: Shorter life
- Olive oil: Variable

### Impact

- Carrier going rancid = product bad
- Even if CBD still potent
- Taste and safety affected

---

## My Take

CBD definitely can go bad—mostly losing potency rather than becoming dangerous. The key is proper storage: cool, dark, and airtight. Check expiration dates when buying, store properly, and don't stockpile more than you'll use in 6-12 months. If it smells or looks off, trust your senses and replace it.
