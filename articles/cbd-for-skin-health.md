## My Take

CBD skincare has moved beyond trend status into legitimate ingredient category. The science supporting anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits is reasonable, and many people find CBD products helpful for various skin concerns.

For acne-prone skin, CBD's sebum-regulating properties are particularly interesting. For aging concerns, the antioxidant effects complement other proven ingredients. For sensitive or inflamed skin, the calming properties make CBD a sensible addition.

The key is choosing well-formulated products with meaningful CBD concentrations and quality supporting ingredients. CBD alone won't transform your skin, but as part of a good skincare routine, it can contribute positively.
