## Quick Summary

The CBD market has quality products and dubious ones. Avoiding common buying mistakes helps ensure you get effective, safe CBD and don't waste money. Here are the ten most common errors and how to avoid them.

---

## Mistake #1: Buying Based on Price Alone

### The Problem

Cheapest isn't best:
- Low-quality CBD exists
- Cheap may mean poor extraction
- May be under-dosed
- Could contain contaminants

### The Solution

- Calculate price per mg CBD
- Compare value, not just price
- Pay for quality
- Mid-range often optimal

---

## Mistake #2: Skipping Lab Report Verification

### The Problem

Without testing:
- CBD content may be wrong
- May contain THC (problematic)
- Could have contaminants
- No accountability

### The Solution

- Always check COA (Certificate of Analysis)
- Look for third-party testing
- Verify batch matches
- No report = don't buy

---

## Mistake #3: Choosing Wrong Spectrum Type

### The Problem

Mismatch causes issues:
- Full-spectrum + drug test = risk
- Isolate may be less effective
- Wrong for your needs

### The Solution

- Understand spectrum options
- Match to your situation
- Drug tested = THC-free
- Otherwise consider full-spectrum

---

## Mistake #4: Unrealistic Expectations

### The Problem

Expecting miracles:
- CBD won't cure everything
- Takes time to work
- Not instant relief
- Disappointment leads to abandonment

### The Solution

- Set realistic goals
- Give it 2-4 weeks
- Understand limitations
- Track subtle improvements

---

## Mistake #5: Starting Dose Too High

### The Problem

Too much too fast:
- May cause unwanted drowsiness
- Wastes product
- Harder to find optimal dose
- More isn't always better

### The Solution

- Start low (10-15mg)
- Increase gradually
- Find minimum effective dose
- Less is often enough

---

## Mistake #6: Inconsistent Use

### The Problem

Sporadic dosing:
- CBD builds up in system
- Inconsistent results
- Hard to assess effectiveness
- Frustration

### The Solution

- Take daily at consistent times
- Give 2+ weeks before judging
- Track your routine
- Consistency matters

---

## Mistake #7: Ignoring Drug Interactions

### The Problem

CBD interacts with medications:
- Especially liver-metabolized drugs
- Can increase or decrease effects
- Potentially serious

### The Solution

- Check with doctor/pharmacist
- Research interactions
- List all medications
- Start low, monitor effects

---

## Mistake #8: Trusting Marketing Claims

### The Problem

Hype vs. reality:
- "Miracle" claims are false
- Not FDA approved for most uses
- Marketing often exaggerates
- Legal language is vague

### The Solution

- Be skeptical of bold claims
- Research actual evidence
- Understand regulations
- Focus on quality indicators

---

## Mistake #9: Wrong Product Type for Goal

### The Problem

Mismatch:
- Topical for anxiety (won't help)
- Edibles for acute pain (too slow)
- Wrong delivery for need

### The Solution

- Match product to purpose
- Oral for systemic issues
- Topical for localized
- Consider onset time

---

## Mistake #10: Buying from Unknown Sources

### The Problem

Questionable retailers:
- No quality assurance
- May be counterfeit
- No recourse if issues
- Potentially unsafe

### The Solution

- Buy from established brands
