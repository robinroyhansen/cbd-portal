## Dosing Guidelines

### During Streams

Recommended:
- 10-25mg for calming

- 25-50mg for recovery
- When alertness isn't needed

## Practical Considerations

Balance carefully:
- CBD calms but shouldn't sedate

## Key Takeaways

1. **Test first** before important streams
2. **Moderate doses** during live performance
3. **Higher doses** acceptable post-stream
4. **Preserve energy** for viewer engagement
5. **Consistent use** helps overall stress

---

## My Take

Streaming combines the pressure of live performance with the demands of sustained audience engagement—it's genuinely stressful work. CBD can help take the edge off pre-stream nerves and support recovery afterward. The critical balance is finding a dose that calms without dulling your energy or reaction time. What works for post-stream wind-down won't work during a live broadcast. Test thoroughly and find your sweet spot.
