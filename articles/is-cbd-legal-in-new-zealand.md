## My Take

New Zealand's prescription-only CBD approach is more restrictive than many other developed countries. While it ensures quality and medical oversight, it also creates barriers to access and increases cost.

If you live in New Zealand and want to try CBD, the legal route is through your doctor. Not all doctors are familiar with or willing to prescribe CBD, so you may need to seek out practitioners experienced with medical cannabis.

For visitors, don't bring CBD to New Zealand—it's not worth the risk. If you genuinely need CBD during your stay, consult a local doctor about getting a prescription.
