## Key Takeaways

1. **Oils most flexible** — best for finding your dose
2. **Capsules most convenient** — once you know your dose
3. **Gummies most enjoyable** — but watch sugar
4. **Topicals for targeted** — localized relief
5. **Avoid vaping** — lung health concerns
6. **Match format to needs** — different situations, different products

---

## My Take

Start with CBD oil if you're new—it lets you adjust your dose easily and find what works for you. Once you know your optimal dose, you can switch to more convenient formats like capsules if you prefer.

I personally use oil for daily use (dose flexibility) and keep gummies for travel or when I want something enjoyable. Topicals are great for post-exercise or targeted discomfort.

Avoid vaping unless you have a specific reason to need ultra-fast onset. The lung health concerns aren't worth it for general wellness use when other formats work well.
