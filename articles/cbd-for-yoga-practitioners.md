## My Take

CBD and yoga are a natural pairing—both aim to bring balance and calm. Many practitioners find that CBD helps them settle into practice more easily, hold poses with less discomfort, and achieve deeper relaxation during shavasana.

Start with low doses. Yoga is about awareness, and you want enhancement, not sedation. Let CBD support your practice rather than dominate it.
