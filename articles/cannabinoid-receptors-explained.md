# Cannabinoid Receptors Explained: CB1, CB2, and Beyond

## Quick Summary

Cannabinoid receptors are proteins in your body that cannabinoids interact with to produce effects. The two main types—[CB1](/knowledge/cb1-receptors) and [CB2](/knowledge/cb2-receptors)—were discovered in the 1990s and form the core of the [endocannabinoid system](/knowledge/endocannabinoid-system). CB1 receptors are concentrated in the brain and nervous system; CB2 receptors are primarily in immune cells. CBD and THC interact with these receptors very differently.

## The Two Main Receptors

### CB1 Receptors
**Location:** Brain, central nervous system, some peripheral tissues
**Discovered:** 1990

**Functions:**
- Pain perception
- Memory and cognition
- Motor control
- Mood regulation
- Appetite
- Sleep

**Key fact:** THC directly activates CB1, causing the "high." CBD does not directly activate CB1, which is why it's non-psychoactive.

### CB2 Receptors
**Location:** Immune cells, peripheral nervous system, some brain areas
**Discovered:** 1993

**Functions:**
- Immune response modulation
- Inflammation regulation
- Pain signaling
- Tissue repair
- Bone health

**Key fact:** CB2 activation does not cause psychoactive effects. [Beta-caryophyllene](/knowledge/what-is-caryophyllene), a terpene, directly activates CB2.

## How Cannabinoids Interact

| Cannabinoid | CB1 Action | CB2 Action |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| THC | Strong agonist (activates) | Partial agonist |
| CBD | Indirect modulator | Indirect modulator |
| CBG | Weak partial agonist | Weak partial agonist |
| CBN | Weak agonist | Moderate agonist |
| Anandamide (endogenous) | Partial agonist | Partial agonist |
| 2-AG (endogenous) | Full agonist | Full agonist |

## CBD's Unique Mechanism

CBD doesn't directly bind to CB1 or CB2 receptors. Instead:

**Indirect Effects:**
- Modulates receptor activity
- May block other compounds from binding
- Enhances endocannabinoid tone
- Inhibits enzyme that breaks down anandamide (FAAH)

**Other Targets:**
- [Serotonin receptors](/knowledge/serotonin-receptors) (5-HT1A) - anxiety, mood
- [TRPV receptors](/knowledge/trpv-receptors) - pain, temperature
- [GPR55](/knowledge/gpr55-receptor) - bone, blood pressure
- [PPARs](/knowledge/ppars) - inflammation, metabolism
- Adenosine receptors - sleep, anxiety

This multi-target approach may explain CBD's broad effects.

## Beyond CB1 and CB2

Research has identified additional cannabinoid-related receptors:

### GPR55 (Putative CB3)
- Found in brain, bone, GI tract
- Involved in bone density, blood pressure
- THC may activate; CBD may block
- Still being characterized

### GPR18
- Found in immune cells, spleen
- Involved in immune regulation
- Responds to some cannabinoids
- Role being researched

### GPR119
- Found in GI tract, pancreas
- Involved in glucose regulation
- May respond to endocannabinoids
- Diabetes research interest

## Receptor Distribution by Body System

| System | CB1 | CB2 | Other Targets |
|--------|-----|-----|---------------|
| Brain | High | Low | GPR55, 5-HT1A |
| Immune | Low | High | GPR55 |
| Gut | Moderate | Moderate | GPR55, GPR119 |
| Skin | Present | Present | TRPV |
| Bone | Low | High | GPR55 |
| Heart | Moderate | Moderate | GPR55 |

## Endogenous Cannabinoids

Your body makes its own cannabinoids that interact with these receptors:

### Anandamide (AEA)
- "Bliss molecule"
- Partial CB1 agonist
- Regulates mood, pain, appetite
- Short-lived (rapidly broken down by FAAH)
- CBD may increase levels by blocking FAAH

### 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)
- Most abundant endocannabinoid
- Full agonist at both CB1 and CB2
- Produced on demand
- Broken down by MAGL enzyme
- Involved in immune regulation

## Why This Matters for CBD Users

Understanding receptors helps explain:

**Why CBD Doesn't Get You High**
CBD doesn't activate CB1 the way THC does. It may even reduce THC's effects by competing at the receptor.

**Why CBD Has Broad Effects**
Acting on multiple receptor systems (not just CB1/CB2) explains how CBD might affect anxiety, pain, inflammation, and sleep.

**Why Entourage Effect May Work**
Different cannabinoids and terpenes hit different receptor targets, potentially creating synergistic effects.

**Why Individual Response Varies**
Genetic variations in receptor expression and enzyme activity affect how people respond to cannabinoids.

## Current Research Directions

Scientists are investigating:
- Development of receptor-specific drugs
- Genetic variations in receptor function
- Role of less-studied receptors (GPR55, etc.)
- How diet and lifestyle affect receptor expression
- Receptor changes in disease states

## My Take

The discovery of cannabinoid receptors transformed our understanding of why cannabis affects humans so profoundly. We're literally built to respond to these compounds—our bodies make similar molecules naturally.

For CBD users, the key insight is that CBD's non-psychoactive nature isn't a limitation but a feature. By working indirectly on CB1/CB2 and directly on other targets, CBD offers potential benefits without the cognitive impairment of THC. The multi-receptor approach also explains why CBD seems to help diverse conditions—it's not doing one thing really well; it's modulating multiple systems.
