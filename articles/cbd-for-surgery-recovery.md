## Key Takeaways

1. **Stop CBD** before surgery (typically 2 weeks)
2. **Disclose use** to surgical team
3. **May help** recovery (pain, sleep, anxiety)
4. **Resume only** with clearance
5. **Watch for** drug interactions

## My Take

Surgery recovery is one area where timing is everything. CBD can potentially help with post-surgical pain, sleep, and anxiety—all important for recovery. But the pre-surgical period requires stopping CBD to avoid interactions with anesthesia.

Be completely honest with your surgical team about CBD use. Follow their specific instructions about stopping before and resuming after surgery. This is one case where medical guidance is absolutely essential.
