## My Take

Guaiol is one of those terpenes that rarely makes headlines but quietly contributes to full-spectrum benefits. Its historical use in traditional medicine and emerging antimicrobial research suggest it's more than just a minor player. While you won't specifically seek guaiol-rich products, its presence indicates a complex, potentially more therapeutic terpene profile.
