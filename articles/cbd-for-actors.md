## Key Takeaways

3. **Test thoroughly** before important performances
4. **Rejection resilience** support valuable
5. **Physical demands** need body care

## My Take

Acting requires a paradox—calm confidence alongside emotional vulnerability. CBD can help with the anxiety that blocks performance without (for most people) dampening the emotional access acting requires. But this balance is individual; some actors find CBD helps them access emotion by removing anxiety, while others feel it creates too much calm.

Test extensively on your own time before using CBD for important work. Know how it affects your specific instrument—your emotions, your presence, your vulnerability. Acting is personal, and so is how CBD affects you.
