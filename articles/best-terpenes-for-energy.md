## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can CBD give me energy?

With the right terpene profile and moderate dose, yes. CBD can reduce fatigue from anxiety and provide calm alertness. However, high-dose or myrcene-dominant products typically have the opposite effect.

### Are energising terpenes like caffeine?

Different mechanism entirely. Terpenes don't work through adenosine receptors like caffeine. They provide motivation and alertness without the jittery feeling or crash. The energy is calmer and more sustainable.

### What if energising CBD products make me tired?

The terpene profile is likely wrong for you. Check for high myrcene content. Some individuals are more sensitive to sedating terpenes. Try different products with explicitly low myrcene.

### Can I use energising terpenes with coffee?

Yes, many people combine them. The calm alertness from pinene/limonene can balance coffee's jitteriness. Start moderate to understand how the combination affects you.

## My Take

I approach energising terpene products differently than most people expect. Instead of looking for something stimulating, I look for something that removes barriers to natural energy—reducing anxiety-fatigue, promoting motivation, supporting clear thinking. Limonene and pinene dominant products do this beautifully. They don't wire me up; they help me feel naturally capable and engaged. That sustainable energy beats any stimulant crash.
