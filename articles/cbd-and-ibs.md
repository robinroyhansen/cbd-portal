## The Short Answer

Does CBD help with IBS? Based on the 6 studies I have reviewed, the evidence is limited. While the [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) plays a significant role in gut function and some patients report symptom relief, clinical trials specifically testing CBD for IBS are scarce. The theoretical basis for cannabinoid use in IBS is strong—the ECS regulates gut motility, inflammation, and pain sensation—but we need more research before making recommendations.

## What the Research Shows

Research on CBD specifically for IBS is limited, though the theoretical basis is compelling. The [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) extensively innervates the gut and regulates:
- Gut motility (speed of digestion)
- Visceral pain perception
- Intestinal inflammation
- Secretion

Some small studies suggest cannabinoids may slow gut motility, which could help diarrhea-predominant IBS but potentially worsen constipation-predominant types. Patient reports are mixed, reflecting IBS's heterogeneous nature.

## My Take

The IBS research is frustratingly sparse given how logical cannabinoid treatment seems. The ECS clearly regulates gut function, and many IBS patients report cannabis helps their symptoms. But without proper trials, I cannot recommend CBD as an IBS treatment.

If you have IBS and want to try CBD, pay attention to your subtype. Diarrhea-predominant IBS might respond differently than constipation-predominant. Keep a symptom diary to track any changes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does CBD slow or speed up digestion?

Cannabinoids generally slow gut motility. This might help diarrhea-predominant IBS but could worsen constipation. Individual responses vary significantly.

### Can CBD interact with IBS medications?

CBD can interact with some medications through the [CYP450](/glossary/cyp450) system. Consult your healthcare provider before combining CBD with prescription IBS treatments.
