Snow sports put unique demands on legs and joints, especially for multi-day trips where cumulative fatigue builds up. CBD can help with recovery and sleep, keeping you fresh for more days on the mountain.

Altitude-related sleep issues are common, and this is where CBD's sleep-supporting effects may be most valuable. Better sleep means better recovery and more enjoyable skiing.
