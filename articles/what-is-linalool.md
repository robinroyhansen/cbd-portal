## My Take

If CBD products worked purely through CBD content, why would some feel more calming than others at the same dose? Linalool content is part of the answer. I particularly value linalool in evening products—the calming quality is noticeable, and the subtle lavender undertones make the experience more pleasant. For sleep or anxiety applications, I'd prioritize products showing meaningful linalool content in their terpene analysis.
