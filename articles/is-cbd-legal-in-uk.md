## Quick Answer

CBD is **legal in the UK** when derived from approved industrial hemp strains and containing less than 1mg THC per container (effectively 0.2% or less). The UK has established specific regulatory frameworks for CBD products, including Novel Food authorization requirements enforced by the Food Standards Agency (FSA).

---

## Legal Status Overview

### What's Legal

- CBD products containing less than 1mg THC per container
- CBD from EU-approved hemp strains (pre-Brexit list applies)
- Cosmetic CBD products meeting safety standards
- CBD isolate products
- Licensed CBD medicines (Epidiolex)

### What's Restricted

- CBD flower (illegal regardless of THC content)
- Products exceeding 1mg THC per container
- CBD products without FSA Novel Food authorization (deadline passed)
- Health claims without MHRA approval

---

## THC Limits Explained

### The UK Rule

The UK uses a unique approach:
- **Maximum 1mg THC per container** (not percentage-based)
- This effectively means most products need very low concentrations
- A 10ml bottle with 1mg THC = 0.01% THC

### Practical Impact

- Most legitimate UK products contain negligible THC
- Many use broad-spectrum or isolate to ensure compliance
- Full-spectrum products must be carefully formulated

---

## Novel Food Requirements

### FSA Regulation

The Food Standards Agency requires:
- All CBD products sold as food to be authorized
- Applications submitted by March 31, 2021 deadline
- Products on FSA public list allowed to remain on sale
- Unauthorized products should be removed from market

### Current Status

- Hundreds of applications pending review
- Products on FSA public list remain available
- Some brands removed for non-compliance
- Enforcement has increased post-deadline

### How to Check Authorization

Visit the FSA public list to verify:
- If a product has a valid application
- The application status
- Which products are compliant

## CBD Flower: Illegal in the UK

### Clear Prohibition

Unlike some EU countries:
- CBD flower is **illegal** in the UK
- Classified as controlled cannabis
- THC content irrelevant
- Cannot be sold, bought, or possessed

### Why This Differs

The UK classifies cannabis by plant material:
- Flowers/buds = controlled regardless of cannabinoid content
- Processed extracts = legal if meeting requirements
- Seeds and stalks = legal

This creates a clear distinction from more permissive EU approaches.

## My Take

The UK CBD market is well-regulated compared to many countries, which is actually good for consumers. The FSA's Novel Food process, while creating hoops for businesses, helps ensure product safety and legitimacy.

When buying CBD in the UK, check the FSA public list and stick to established brands. The market has consolidated around compliant products, making it easier to find trustworthy options than in less regulated markets.

The clear prohibition on CBD flower is stricter than much of Europe, so be aware of this if you're used to different rules elsewhere.
