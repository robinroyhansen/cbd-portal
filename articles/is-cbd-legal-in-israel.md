## My Take

Israel's position as a cannabis research leader makes it a fascinating market. The country where THC was first isolated by Dr. Raphael Mechoulam has a sophisticated understanding of cannabinoids, and this shows in the quality of products emerging from Israeli companies.

For visitors, CBD is accessible, especially in Tel Aviv. The main consideration is ensuring you're buying low-THC CBD products rather than medical cannabis products that require prescriptions.

The medical cannabis program is excellent but separate from the consumer CBD market. If you're a tourist looking for CBD, stick to over-the-counter products from established retailers.
