## Quick Answer

CBD products typically last **1-2 years** when stored properly. Store in a **cool, dark, dry place** away from heat and light. Refrigeration extends shelf life but isn't usually necessary. Once opened, use within 6-12 months for best potency.

| Product Type | Typical Shelf Life | After Opening |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **CBD Oil/Tincture** | 1-2 years | 6-12 months |
| **CBD Capsules** | 1-2 years | 12 months |

## What Degrades CBD?

### The Four Enemies

| Factor | How It Degrades CBD |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Light** | UV causes oxidation, breaks down cannabinoids |
| **Heat** | Accelerates degradation |
| **Air** | Oxygen causes oxidation |
| **Humidity** | Can cause mold, bacteria |

### How Degradation Shows

- Reduced potency
- Changed color (darker)
- Changed taste/smell
- Separation or cloudiness
- Reduced effectiveness

## Proper Storage

### Ideal Conditions

**Temperature:** 
- Room temperature (60-70°F / 15-21°C)
- Away from heat sources
- Avoid temperature fluctuations

**Light:**
- Dark place (cabinet, drawer)
- Away from windows
- Keep in original container (usually amber/dark)

**Air:**
- Keep container sealed
- Minimize opening
- Close tightly after use

**Humidity:**
- Dry environment
- Avoid bathroom storage
- Keep away from moisture

### Best Storage Locations

✓ Kitchen cabinet (away from stove)
✓ Bedroom drawer
✓ Closet shelf
✓ Medicine cabinet (if dry)

### Avoid

✗ Windowsill
✗ Near stove/oven
✗ In bathroom
✗ In car
✗ Direct sunlight anywhere

## Should You Refrigerate CBD?

### Refrigeration Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- Extends shelf life
- Slows degradation
- Good for long-term storage
- Protects from heat

**Cons:**
- Oil may thicken
- Inconvenient for daily use
- Condensation risk
- Not necessary for normal use period

### When to Refrigerate

- Storing for extended period
- Living in hot climate without AC
- Bulk purchase
- After opening large bottle

### How to Use Refrigerated CBD

1. Remove from fridge
2. Let warm to room temperature (10-15 minutes)
3. Shake well
4. Use as normal
5. Return to fridge if storing long-term

## Signs Your CBD Has Gone Bad

### What to Look For

| Sign | What It Means |
|------|--------------|
| **Murky/cloudy** | Possible degradation or separation |
| **Significantly darker** | Oxidation |
| **Changed smell** | Degradation |
| **Off taste** | Degradation |
| **Separation** | May need shaking, or degradation |
| **Thick/gummy texture** | Temperature damage |

### Is Bad CBD Harmful?

Expired/degraded CBD:
- Probably not harmful
- But likely less effective
- Potency reduced
- Not worth using
- Replace if showing signs

## Reading Expiration Dates

### What to Know

**Best by date:**
- Manufacturer's recommendation
- Product may be fine after
- Potency guaranteed until this date

**Manufacture date:**
- When product was made
- Calculate 1-2 year shelf life from this

**Lot number:**
- Track product batch
- Useful if quality issues
- Matches lab reports

- Buy from retailers with turnover
- Don't bulk buy too far ahead

## Traveling with CBD

### Temporary Storage Considerations

**Short trips:**
- Keep in carry-on (stable temperature)
- Avoid checked luggage (temperature extremes)
- Original packaging recommended

**Hot destinations:**
- Keep cool as possible
- Don't leave in hot car
- Use insulated bag if needed

**Cold destinations:**
- Less concern
- May thicken (normal)
- Will return to normal at room temp

## Key Takeaways

1. **1-2 year shelf life** typical
2. **Store cool, dark, dry** — avoid light, heat, humidity
3. **Refrigeration optional** — extends life but not required
4. **After opening** — use within 6-12 months
5. **Signs of degradation** — color change, cloudiness, smell
6. **Expired CBD** — less potent but probably not harmful

## My Take

Proper storage is simple but important. Most CBD products are pretty stable if you follow basic rules: keep them cool, dark, and sealed. A kitchen cabinet or bedroom drawer works perfectly.

You don't need to refrigerate CBD for normal use, but if you buy in bulk or live somewhere very hot, refrigeration extends shelf life significantly.

The most common mistake is leaving CBD in a car or by a sunny window. Heat and light are the biggest enemies. If your product has changed significantly in color or smell, it's probably degraded enough to replace.

Check expiration dates when buying—fresh products give you the full shelf life window.
