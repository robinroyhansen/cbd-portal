## My Take

CBD and meditation can complement each other nicely. Both promote calm, present-focused states, and CBD's effects may help create optimal conditions for practice—especially for those who struggle with racing thoughts or physical discomfort during sitting.

The key is finding the right dose. You want subtle relaxation, not drowsiness. Start lower than your usual dose and see how it affects your practice. Some find it helpful; others prefer to keep their meditation practice substance-free.

Remember that CBD is an optional enhancement. The real work of meditation—developing attention, cultivating awareness—still requires practice and technique.
