## Quick Summary

Sublingual CBD (held under the tongue) works faster and absorbs more efficiently than edibles (swallowed), but edibles last longer. Sublingual onset is 15-30 minutes with 20-35% bioavailability; edibles take 30-90 minutes with 10-20% bioavailability. Choose sublingual for flexibility and speed, edibles for convenience and duration.

## Key Takeaways

- Sublingual: faster, more efficient
- Edibles: longer-lasting, more convenient
- Different absorption routes
- Both effective, different strengths
- Many people use both

---

## How Each Works

### Sublingual Absorption

**Process:**
1. Oil held under tongue
2. CBD absorbs through mucous membranes
3. Enters bloodstream directly
4. Bypasses digestive system
5. Avoids first-pass metabolism

**Result:**
- Faster onset
- Higher bioavailability
- Shorter duration

### Edible Absorption

**Process:**
1. CBD swallowed
2. Processed through digestive system
3. First-pass metabolism in liver
4. Gradual bloodstream entry
5. Extended release

**Result:**
- Slower onset
- Lower bioavailability
- Longer duration

## Detailed Comparison

| Factor | Sublingual | Edibles |
|--------|------------|---------|

## Bioavailability Explained

### What It Means

How much CBD actually reaches your bloodstream.

### Sublingual Advantage

**20-35% Absorption:**
- Bypasses liver initially
- Less CBD lost to metabolism
- More efficient use
- Lower doses may suffice

### Edibles Limitation

**10-20% Absorption:**
- First-pass metabolism
- Significant CBD lost in liver
- May need higher doses
- Less efficient

### Practical Impact

**Example:**
- 30mg sublingual → ~8-10mg reaches blood
- 30mg edible → ~4-6mg reaches blood
- Same dose, different effective amounts

---

## Speed Comparison

### Sublingual Onset

**15-30 Minutes:**
- Useful for acute needs
- Predictable timing
- Can feel effects sooner
- Good when you want faster action

### Edible Onset

**30-90 Minutes:**
- Requires planning ahead
- Individual variation
- Food affects timing
- Patience needed

---

## Duration Comparison

### Sublingual Duration

**4-6 Hours:**
- Shorter effects window
- May need multiple doses
- Good for specific periods
- Wears off predictably

### Edible Duration

**6-8 Hours:**
- Longer-lasting effects
- Better for overnight
- Fewer doses needed
- Extended relief

---

## When to Choose Sublingual

### Best Situations

**Flexibility Needed:**
- Adjusting dose throughout day
- Trying new products
- Finding your dose
- Varying needs

**Speed Matters:**
- Acute situations
- Unpredictable needs

**Taste Concerns:**
- Dislike hemp taste
- Want pleasant experience
- Candy/food format preferred
- More enjoyable

**Duration Needed:**

- Fewer doses preferred
- Extended effects

---

## Combining Both

### Strategic Use

**Many People:**
- Sublingual for baseline/acute
- Edibles for specific times
- Best of both worlds
- Flexible approach

### Example Protocol

**Daily Routine:**

## Practical Considerations

- Very discreet
- No explanation needed
- Socially easier

### While Traveling

## Dosing Comparison

### Sublingual Dosing

**Advantages:**
- Adjust drop by drop
- Precise control
- Easy to titrate
- Flexible

**Calculation:**
- Know mg/ml
- Count drops or use dropper markings
- Adjust as needed

### Edible Dosing

**Advantages:**
- Pre-measured

- Simple

**Limitation:**
- Fixed doses
- Can't easily split
- Less flexible

---

## Cost Considerations

### Sublingual (Oil)

**Generally:**
- Better value per effective mg
- Higher bioavailability means less needed
- More CBD actually works

### Edibles (Gummies, etc.)

**Generally:**
- Higher cost per effective mg
- Lower bioavailability
- More CBD required
- But convenience has value

## For Different Goals

### For Anxiety

## My Take

The sublingual vs. edibles choice comes down to what matters most to you. If you want efficiency, flexibility, and faster effects, sublingual oil is superior—you absorb more CBD and feel it sooner. If you want convenience, pleasant taste, and longer-lasting effects, edibles win—they're easier to take and last longer. For comprehensive use, consider both: sublingual for daily flexibility and acute needs, edibles for specific situations like sleep or all-day coverage. There's no wrong answer, only what fits your life.
