## My Take

The legal profession has serious wellness problems—high rates of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. CBD offers a non-impairing option for stress and sleep management, which can be part of a healthier approach to legal practice.

Use it off-hours to maintain the cognitive sharpness your work demands. And remember: CBD helps with symptoms, but if you're fundamentally burned out, you need bigger changes than a wellness supplement can provide.
