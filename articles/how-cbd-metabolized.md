## Quick Summary

CBD is primarily metabolised in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP2C19. This process creates various metabolites and significantly reduces the amount of CBD reaching your bloodstream through oral administration.

## Key Takeaways

- Liver enzymes (CYP450 family) process CBD
- First-pass metabolism reduces oral bioavailability
- Multiple metabolites created, some may be active
- CBD affects the same enzymes, creating drug interactions
- Genetic variations affect metabolism speed

## The Metabolic Process

### First-Pass Metabolism

When you swallow CBD:
1. Absorbed through intestinal wall
2. Travels via portal vein to liver
3. Processed by liver enzymes before reaching circulation
4. 60-80% of CBD broken down before reaching bloodstream

This explains why oral bioavailability is so low.

### CYP450 Enzymes

Primary enzymes metabolising CBD:
- **CYP3A4** — Main metabolic pathway
- **CYP2C19** — Secondary pathway
- **CYP2C9** — Minor contribution
- **CYP1A1** — Minor contribution

### Metabolites

CBD is converted to:
- 7-OH-CBD (may be active)
- 7-COOH-CBD (inactive)
- Various hydroxylated metabolites
- Glucuronide conjugates (for elimination)

## Drug Interaction Mechanism

### Why It Matters

CBD inhibits some CYP450 enzymes:
- Other drugs may accumulate
- Effects may be stronger than intended
- Timing of doses matters

### High-Risk Medications

Particular concern with:
- Blood thinners (warfarin)
- Heart medications
- Anti-seizure drugs
- Some antidepressants
- Immunosuppressants

---

## Genetic Variations

### Metaboliser Types

People vary in enzyme activity:
- **Fast metabolisers:** CBD cleared quickly, may need higher doses
- **Slow metabolisers:** CBD persists longer, lower doses may suffice

### Implications

Genetic testing can reveal:
- Why doses affect people differently
- Potential interaction risks
- Optimal dosing strategies

## My Take

Metabolism is why CBD affects everyone differently. Understanding that liver enzymes process CBD—and that these enzymes also process many medications—is crucial safety knowledge. If you're on any medications, discuss CBD with your healthcare provider before starting.
