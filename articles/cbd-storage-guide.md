## Should You Refrigerate?

### When It Helps

Refrigeration:

- Good for long-term storage
- Not required for most products
- May thicken oils

### When Not Needed

Skip refrigeration:
- If using product regularly
- For topicals (may harden)
- If you don't want to wait for warming

### If You Refrigerate

Tips:
- Allow oil to warm before use
- Oil may get thick—this is normal
- Gummies may get hard
- Bring to room temp if needed

## Travel Storage

### On the Go

Tips:

## Key Takeaways

1. **Light, heat, air** damage CBD
2. **Cool, dark places** are ideal
3. **Original packaging** usually works well
4. **Refrigeration is optional** for most products
5. **Use within** 6-12 months of opening

## My Take

CBD storage isn't complicated—just think of it like cooking oils or vitamins. Keep it away from light and heat, close it properly after use, and you'll maintain potency throughout the product's useful life.

The biggest mistake I see is leaving CBD products in hot cars or on sunny windowsills. A few minutes won't ruin them, but regular exposure degrades quality quickly.
