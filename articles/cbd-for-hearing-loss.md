## Key Takeaways

1. **No evidence** CBD helps hearing loss
2. **Can't regenerate** damaged hearing structures
3. **Claims are unfounded**
4. **Prevention** is the best approach
5. **See audiologist** for hearing concerns

## My Take

I have to be direct: there's no scientific basis for using CBD to help hearing loss. Hearing loss involves damage to delicate structures in the ear that CBD cannot repair or regenerate.

If you have hearing concerns, see an audiologist for proper evaluation. Focus on protecting the hearing you have and getting appropriate treatment (hearing aids, etc.) if needed.
