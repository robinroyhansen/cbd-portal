## My Take

Croatia's CBD market is developing but not as mature as Western European countries. Zagreb has reasonable availability, and Split/Dubrovnik serve tourists, but don't expect the same variety as Germany or the UK.

For tourists, if you have specific CBD preferences, bring what you need. You'll find options in major cities, but selection may be limited compared to what you're used to.

The country's growing hemp industry is a positive sign for the future of the Croatian CBD market.
