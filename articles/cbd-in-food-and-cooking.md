## Understanding CBD in Food

### Why Add CBD to Food?

Benefits:
- Enjoyable way to take CBD
- Masks hemp taste
- Consistent with meals
- Creative options

### Challenges

Considerations:
- Heat can degrade CBD
- Absorption varies
- Dosing less precise
- Takes longer to work

---

## Heat and CBD

### Temperature Sensitivity

Important:
- CBD degrades above ~320°F (160°C)
- High heat destroys CBD
- Baking can reduce potency
- Stovetop cooking varies

### Safe Cooking Temperatures

Guidelines:
- Below 320°F is safest
- Light sautéing usually okay
- Avoid frying or high-heat roasting
- Add after cooking when possible

### Best Practices

Protect CBD:
- Add to finished dishes
- Use in no-bake recipes
- Low-temperature cooking only
- Infuse into fats first

---

## Fats and Absorption

### Why Fat Matters

CBD is fat-soluble:
- Absorbs better with fat
- Fatty foods improve uptake
- Oils and butters ideal
- Include fat in CBD recipes

### Best Fats for CBD

Options:
- Coconut oil
- Olive oil
- Butter/ghee
- MCT oil

### Infusing Oils and Butters

How to:
- Low heat (150-200°F)
- Mix CBD into fat
- Stir well to distribute
- Store properly

---

## Dosing in Food

### Challenges

Issues:
- Uneven distribution possible
- Serving size affects dose
- Hard to measure precisely
- May need more due to absorption

### How to Dose

Approach:
- Calculate total CBD in recipe
- Divide by servings
- Account for some loss
- Start with lower amounts

### Example Calculation

Math:
- 30mg CBD per serving desired
- Recipe makes 8 servings
- Need 240mg total minimum
- Add 300mg to account for loss

---

## Best Foods for CBD

### Ideal Options

Work well:
- Smoothies and shakes
- Salad dressings
- Dips and spreads
- Coffee drinks
- No-bake desserts

### Good Options

With care:
- Baked goods (low temp)
- Chocolates
- Sauces (add at end)
- Soups (add when cooling)

### Less Ideal

Problematic:
- Deep-fried foods
- High-temp roasting
- Grilling directly
- Anything above 320°F

---

## Easy CBD Recipes

### CBD Smoothie

Simple:
- Add CBD oil directly
- Blend with ingredients
- Fat source helps (nut butter, coconut)
- Consistent dosing

### CBD Salad Dressing

Easy infusion:
- Mix CBD into olive oil
- Add vinegar and seasonings
- Shake well
- Dose per tablespoon

### CBD Coffee/Tea

Beverage:
- Add to warm (not boiling) drink
- Include fat source (cream, butter)
- Stir well
- Start with lower dose

### CBD Honey

Versatile:
- Mix CBD oil into honey
- Store at room temperature
- Use in tea, toast, etc.
- Calculate dose per serving

---

## Storage of CBD Foods

### Shelf Life

Considerations:
- CBD can degrade over time
- Light and heat accelerate
- Store in cool, dark place
- Make smaller batches

### Best Practices

Preservation:
- Refrigerate when appropriate
- Airtight containers
- Opaque containers better
- Use within reasonable time

---

## Taste Considerations

### Hemp Flavor

Reality:
- CBD oil has earthy taste
- Some find it unpleasant
- Flavored oils available
- Food masks taste

### Masking Flavor

Strategies:
- Chocolate works well
- Strong flavors help
- Citrus can offset
- Sweetness balances

## Key Takeaways

1. **Heat degrades CBD**—stay below 320°F
2. **Fat improves** absorption
3. **Add to finished** dishes when possible
4. **Calculate doses** carefully
5. **No-cook options** are simplest

---

## My Take

CBD in food is enjoyable but not the most efficient delivery method. If you're using CBD for specific therapeutic purposes, sublingual oil is more reliable. But for general wellness and enjoyable daily use, CBD foods can work well.

The key is respecting temperature limits and including fat for absorption. My favorite approach is adding CBD to already-prepared warm (not hot) foods, or using it in no-cook applications like smoothies and dressings.
