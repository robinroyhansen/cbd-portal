## My Take

Joint health is one of the most common reasons people try CBD, and the anti-inflammatory mechanisms provide a reasonable basis for benefit. Combining oral CBD for systemic support with topical application to specific joints often works well. Remember that CBD supports joint health but doesn't replace proper diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions.
