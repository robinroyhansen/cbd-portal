## Understanding CBD Pricing

### Why CBD Costs What It Does

Factors:
- Hemp cultivation costs
- Extraction and processing
- Third-party testing
- Quality control
- Brand and marketing

### Price Ranges

Typical costs:
- Budget: $0.03-0.05 per mg
- Mid-range: $0.05-0.10 per mg
- Premium: $0.10-0.15+ per mg
- Ultra-premium: $0.15+ per mg

### Price vs Quality

Reality:
- Cheapest isn't always best
- Most expensive isn't always necessary
- Mid-range often good value
- Focus on cost per mg

## Where to Save Money

### Buy Higher Strength

Simple math:
- Higher mg bottles cost more upfront
- But cost less per mg
- 3000mg bottle better value than 500mg
- Buy what you'll actually use

### Subscriptions

Ongoing savings:
- 10-30% off typically
- Auto-delivery convenience
- Only if you'll use consistently
- Easy cancellation important

### Sales and Promotions

Timing purchases:
- Black Friday/Cyber Monday
- Holiday sales
- Brand anniversaries
- Email list discounts

### Direct from Brand

Skip middlemen:
- Buy from manufacturer
- Avoid retailer markup
- Often better deals
- May have exclusive offers

## Where Not to Cheap Out

### Never Compromise On

Quality essentials:
- Third-party testing
- Reputable brand
- Proper extraction
- Actual CBD content

### Why Quality Matters

The risk:
- Cheap products may contain less CBD
- Contamination risks
- Ineffective products waste money
- Buying cheap twice costs more

### Red Flags for Too-Cheap

Avoid if:
- No third-party testing
- Unknown brand
- Unrealistic prices
- No COA available

## Value Strategies

### Calculate Cost Per Mg

How:
- Divide bottle price by total mg
- Compare across products
- Focus on this number
- Not bottle price

### Example Calculations

Comparison:
- $30 for 500mg = $0.06/mg
- $60 for 1500mg = $0.04/mg
- $100 for 3000mg = $0.033/mg
- Bigger bottle = better value

### Optimize Your Dose

Efficiency:
- Find minimum effective dose
- Don't take more than needed
- Track what actually works
- Avoid waste

## Best Value Products

### What's Less Value

- Premium packaging
- Specialty products

---

## Budget-Friendly Brands

## Key Takeaways

1. **Calculate cost per mg**—not bottle price
2. **Higher strength** = better value
3. **Never compromise** on testing
4. **Subscriptions** save money
5. **Time purchases** around sales

---

## My Take

You don't need to spend a fortune on CBD, but you also can't expect quality at rock-bottom prices. The sweet spot is mid-range products from reputable brands, bought in higher strengths during sales or through subscriptions.

The biggest waste of money is buying cheap, untested products that may not even contain what they claim. A quality mid-range product is infinitely better value than a cheap product that doesn't work.
