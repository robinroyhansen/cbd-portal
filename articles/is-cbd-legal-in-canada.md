## Quick Answer

CBD is **legal in Canada**, but unlike the US, it's regulated under the **Cannabis Act** alongside THC products. This means CBD is sold through licensed cannabis retailers and online government stores, not in general health food stores. Canada has full cannabis legalization, so CBD access is straightforward but regulated.

## Canada's Approach

### Full Cannabis Legalization

Canada legalized recreational cannabis in 2018:
- Both THC and CBD products legal
- Regulated under the Cannabis Act
- Provincial/territorial systems vary
- Licensed retail only

### How This Affects CBD

Unlike countries that separate hemp-CBD:
- CBD treated as cannabis product
- Must be purchased through licensed channels
- Cannot be sold as regular supplement in stores
- Higher regulation, but also quality assurance

## Key Takeaways

5. **Cannot travel internationally** with Canadian CBD

## My Take

Canada's approach to CBD is unique—full cannabis legalization means CBD comes through the same regulated channels as THC products. This is more restrictive than the US (no CBD at Whole Foods), but provides better quality assurance.

For Canadians, this means:
- You know what you're getting (tested, labeled)
- Higher prices than unregulated markets
- Limited to licensed retail
- Complete legality and clarity

For visitors, buy through official channels, enjoy the regulated products, and don't try to take anything home. Canada's system works well once you understand it.
