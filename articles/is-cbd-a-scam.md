CBD isn't a scam, but the CBD industry has scammers in it—like any industry. The compound is real, the research is real, and quality products exist. The problem is marketing that overpromises and products that underdeliver. Do your homework, buy from reputable brands, have realistic expectations, and you'll find legitimate products that may or may not work for you—which is honest.
