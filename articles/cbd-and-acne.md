## The Short Answer

Does CBD help with acne? Based on the 3 studies I have reviewed, there is insufficient evidence to recommend CBD for acne. One notable laboratory study showed CBD reduced sebum production and had [anti-inflammatory](/glossary/anti-inflammatory) effects on skin cells—a promising finding. However, human clinical trials are lacking, and we cannot yet confirm these laboratory effects translate to real acne improvement.

## What the Research Shows

A landmark 2014 laboratory study found that CBD:
- Reduced sebum (oil) production in sebocytes
- Decreased inflammatory responses
- Had anti-proliferative effects on skin cells

These findings suggest CBD could theoretically help acne by reducing oil production and inflammation. However, laboratory findings don't always translate to human benefit.

A small human study testing a CBD facial cream showed some hydrating benefits but did not specifically measure acne improvement.

## My Take

The 2014 sebocyte study was exciting and sparked significant interest in CBD for acne. However, nearly a decade later, we still lack proper clinical trials confirming these effects in real acne patients.

I cannot recommend CBD as an acne treatment based on current evidence. If you want to try it anyway, topical application makes the most sense—at least you're applying it where the acne is. But established acne treatments (benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, etc.) have far more evidence behind them.
