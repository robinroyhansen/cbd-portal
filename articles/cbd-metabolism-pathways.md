# CBD Metabolism Pathways: How Your Body Breaks Down CBD

## Quick Summary

CBD is metabolized primarily by liver enzymes (CYP450 family), producing over 100 metabolites. The main metabolites are 7-OH-CBD and 7-COOH-CBD. Metabolism varies significantly between individuals due to genetics, age, and other factors. Understanding metabolism explains drug interactions, individual variation in effects, and why the same dose affects people differently.

## Primary Metabolism Route

### Phase 1: CYP450 Enzymes

CBD is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes:

**CYP3A4** (Major)
- Responsible for most CBD metabolism
- Also metabolizes ~50% of all medications
- Activity varies 10-fold between individuals

**CYP2C19** (Significant)
- Secondary metabolism pathway
- Genetic variants common
- Poor metabolizers exist

**CYP2C9** (Minor)
- Contributes to CBD breakdown
- Also important for warfarin metabolism
- Genetic variants affect activity

**CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2D6** (Minor)
- Small contributions
- May become significant if primary pathways saturated

---

## Major Metabolites

### 7-Hydroxy-CBD (7-OH-CBD)
- Primary active metabolite
- May have biological activity
- Formed by hydroxylation
- Further metabolized to 7-COOH-CBD

### 7-Carboxy-CBD (7-COOH-CBD)
- Major inactive metabolite
- End product of 7-OH-CBD oxidation
- Excreted in urine and feces
- Long half-life—detectable for weeks

### Other Metabolites
- Over 100 metabolites identified
- Many are hydroxylated or carboxylated derivatives
- Some may be pharmacologically active
- Not fully characterized

## First-Pass Metabolism

When CBD is swallowed:

```
Oral CBD → Stomach → Intestine → Portal Vein → Liver → Systemic Circulation
```

**First-pass effect:**
- CBD passes through liver before reaching body
- Significant portion metabolized immediately
- Explains low oral bioavailability (6-19%)
- Produces metabolites that may have effects

**Bypassing first-pass:**
- Sublingual absorption (partial)
- Inhalation (mostly bypasses liver)
- Topical (local action, minimal systemic)

---

## Factors Affecting Metabolism

### Genetics
**CYP2C19 polymorphisms:**
- Poor metabolizers: Slower breakdown
- Ultrarapid metabolizers: Faster breakdown
- Affects optimal dosing

**CYP3A4 variants:**
- Less common but significant
- Can affect multiple medications

### Age
- Liver function declines with age
- Slower metabolism in elderly
- May need lower doses

### Other Medications
- Many drugs use same CYP enzymes
- Competition can alter CBD metabolism
- Can also alter other drug metabolism

### Liver Function
- Liver disease affects metabolism
- May need dose adjustment
- Medical supervision recommended

### Food and Timing
- Fatty foods increase absorption
- May affect metabolism rate
- Consistent timing recommended

## Drug Interactions via Metabolism

CBD inhibits CYP3A4 and CYP2C19:

### Medications Potentially Affected

| Drug Class | Examples | Concern |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Anticonvulsants | Clobazam, valproate | Increased levels |
| Blood thinners | Warfarin | Increased effect |
| Statins | Some types | Increased levels |
| Immunosuppressants | Cyclosporine, tacrolimus | Toxicity risk |
| Benzodiazepines | Diazepam, midazolam | Enhanced sedation |
| Opioids | Some types | Variable effects |

**Important:** Always consult healthcare providers about potential interactions.

## Metabolite Detection

Drug testing considerations:

**CBD Metabolites**
- Not typically tested for
- Different from THC metabolites
- Can be detected if specifically tested

**THC Contamination**
- Full-spectrum products contain trace THC
- THC metabolites (THC-COOH) are tested
- May cause positive drug tests
- CBD isolate safer for drug testing

**Detection Windows**
- Blood: Days
- Urine: Weeks (for regular users)
- Hair: Months
- Varies by use pattern

---

## Steady State Considerations

With regular use:

**Accumulation**
- CBD and metabolites accumulate
- Steady state: ~1 week daily dosing
- Metabolites may persist longer
- Effects may build over time

**Enzyme Induction/Inhibition**
- CBD inhibits certain CYP enzymes
- May affect other medication metabolism
- Effects on enzymes can persist

---

## Individual Variation

Same dose, different results:

**Example: 25mg oral CBD**
| Factor | Person A | Person B |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Bioavailability | 15% | 8% |
| CYP2C19 status | Normal | Poor metabolizer |
| Body weight | 70kg | 100kg |
| Effective CBD | ~2.5mg | ~1.5mg |
| Duration | Shorter | Longer |

This explains why dosing is so individual.

## Practical Implications

**For Users:**
1. Start low—metabolism varies
2. Be consistent—steady state matters
3. Take with food for better absorption
4. Check for drug interactions
5. Give it time—effects may build

**For Healthcare Providers:**
1. Consider genetic testing for complex cases
2. Monitor liver enzymes with high doses
3. Review medication interactions
4. Adjust doses for liver impairment
5. Consider metabolites in effect assessment

## My Take

Understanding CBD metabolism transformed how I advise people on dosing. The dramatic variation in CYP enzyme activity explains why some people feel a lot from 10mg while others need 100mg. It's not just placebo or perception—it's biology.

The drug interaction piece is crucial and often overlooked. I always ask about medications before recommending CBD, particularly for older adults who may be on multiple prescriptions. The same CYP enzymes that break down CBD break down many medications, and that interaction is real.
