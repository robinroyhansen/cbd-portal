## My Take

Wedding day anxiety is so common that there's an entire industry around it. CBD offers a natural way to take the edge off without the numbness that some anti-anxiety options create. You want to feel present and emotionally available for your wedding, not sedated through it.

The key is testing your protocol beforehand. Your wedding is not the day to discover CBD makes you drowsy or doesn't work at your chosen dose. Test at similar events so you know exactly what to expect.
