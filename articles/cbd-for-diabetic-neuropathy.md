## Key Takeaways

3. **Blood sugar control** remains essential
4. **Doesn't treat** underlying diabetes
5. **Complement** to standard care

## My Take

Diabetic neuropathy is challenging to treat, and I understand the appeal of CBD given its neuropathic pain potential. It may help manage the pain component of this condition.

But remember: the primary treatment is diabetes management. Good blood sugar control prevents neuropathy from progressing. Use CBD as a potential pain management tool alongside proper diabetic care, not instead of it.
