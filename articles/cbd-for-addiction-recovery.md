## My Take

CBD's potential role in addiction recovery is one of the more exciting research areas. The early studies are promising, particularly for helping with cravings and the anxiety that often triggers relapse.

But I want to be clear: CBD isn't a magic solution for addiction. Professional treatment, therapy, support groups, and evidence-based approaches remain essential. CBD might be a helpful addition to a comprehensive recovery plan, but not a substitute.
