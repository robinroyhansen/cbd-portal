## My Take

A bedtime routine is powerful for sleep, and CBD fits naturally into it. The key is consistency—same time, same sequence, every night. Your brain learns that CBD signals sleep time, making the whole process easier.

Don't just take CBD and expect magic. Use it as part of a genuine wind-down routine with dim lights, calm activities, and no screens. The combination is more powerful than CBD alone.
