## Key Takeaways

1. **Many fighters use CBD** for recovery
2. **USADA allows CBD** but not THC
3. **THC-free products essential** for tested fighters
4. **Higher doses** often used given training intensity
5. **Sleep support** is major benefit

---

## My Take

MMA is brutal on the body, and fighters need every recovery tool available. CBD has become standard in many gyms because it offers anti-inflammatory and sleep benefits without impairing training or being prohibited.

The key for competing fighters: absolutely use THC-free products with verified testing. A failed drug test ends careers. The discount from full-spectrum isn't worth the risk.
