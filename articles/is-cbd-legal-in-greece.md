## My Take

Greece's CBD market is developing but not as mature as Western European countries. Athens has reasonable availability, but if you're heading to the islands or smaller towns, bring what you need.

The country's investment in medical cannabis and hemp farming suggests the CBD market will continue growing. For now, major cities serve CBD users adequately, and online options fill gaps.
