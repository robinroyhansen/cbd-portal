## Key Takeaways

1. **MCT oil** is most popular for good reason
2. **Hemp seed** adds nutrition but stronger taste
3. **Carrier affects** absorption and flavor
4. **Consider allergies** when choosing
5. **All work**—choose based on preference

---

## My Take

MCT oil is my default recommendation for most people—it absorbs well, has neutral taste, and is stable. But there's no wrong choice among quality carrier oils.

If you have specific preferences or concerns (coconut allergy, want nutrition, prefer familiar oils), choose accordingly. The carrier oil is less important than the CBD quality itself—all the common carriers work adequately.
