## Quick Summary

CBD sleep research is growing but still limited, with evidence suggesting CBD may improve sleep quality, particularly when anxiety contributes to sleep problems. Effects appear dose-dependent, with higher doses more sedating. Most studies are small, and large-scale clinical trials are needed.

## Key Takeaways

- CBD may improve sleep, especially anxiety-related
- Higher doses tend to be more sedating
- Evidence is promising but limited
- Most studies have small samples
- Sleep may be secondary to anxiety reduction

## Key Human Studies

### Shannon et al. (2019)

**Study Details:**
- Design: Case series
- Participants: 72 adults
- Conditions: Anxiety and/or poor sleep
- Dose: 25-175mg/day (typically 25-50mg)
- Duration: 3 months

**Sleep Findings:**
- 66.7% improved sleep first month
- Fluctuated over time
- Less consistent than anxiety improvement
- Generally well-tolerated

**Significance:**
- Real-world clinical setting
- Longer duration than many studies
- Combined anxiety/sleep assessment
- Limitations: uncontrolled

### Carlini and Cunha (1981) - Early Research

**Study Details:**
- Design: Double-blind, placebo-controlled
- Participants: 15 insomnia patients
- Doses: 40-160mg CBD
- Duration: Short-term

**Key Findings:**
- Higher doses (160mg) improved sleep
- Increased total sleep time
- Fewer interruptions
- Dose-dependent effect

**Significance:**
- Early controlled evidence
- Suggested dose relationship
- Foundation for later research

## Sleep and Anxiety Studies

### Zuardi et al. (Multiple Studies)

**Observations:**
- Anxiety reduction often improved sleep
- Secondary benefit
- Mechanism overlap
- Difficult to separate effects

### Linares et al. (2019)

**Relevance:**
- Primarily anxiety study
- Sleep measures included
- Dose-response noted
- 300mg showed effects

---

## Sleep Disorder Specific Research

### REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder

**Chagas et al. (2014):**
- Design: Case series
- Participants: 4 Parkinson's patients with RBD
- Dose: 75-300mg CBD
- Finding: Reduced RBD symptoms
- Significance: First RBD research

### Sleep Apnea

**Limited Research:**
- Mostly preclinical
- Animal studies suggest benefit
- Human trials needed
- Mechanism plausible

### Insomnia

**Growing Interest:**
- Several ongoing trials
- Consumer use high
- Controlled data limited
- Research expanding

---

## Mechanism Research

### How CBD May Affect Sleep

**Potential Mechanisms:**
- Anxiety reduction (indirect)
- GABA modulation
- Serotonin receptor effects
- Circadian rhythm influence
- Pain reduction (when relevant)

### Dose-Dependent Effects

**Research Suggests:**
- Low doses: May be alerting
- Higher doses: More sedating
- Individual variation
- Context-dependent

## CBD vs THC for Sleep

### Different Profiles

| Factor | CBD | THC |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Sedation | Dose-dependent | Generally sedating |
| REM sleep | May increase | Typically suppresses |
| Tolerance | Less likely | Develops |
| Next-day effects | Fewer | Possible hangover |

### Combination Effects

- Some use together
- Different contributions
- THC more directly sedating
- CBD may balance

---

## Real-World Evidence

### Consumer Reports

**Survey Data Shows:**
- Sleep is top 3 reason for use
- High satisfaction reported
- Improved sleep quality claims
- Duration improvements noted

### Limitations

- Self-report bias
- Placebo effect possible
- Product variation
- Expectation effects

---

## Current Limitations

### Research Gaps

**Major Issues:**
- Few large RCTs
- Short study durations
- Various sleep measures used
- Different conditions grouped

### Methodological Needs

- Sleep lab studies
- Objective measures (PSG)
- Longer follow-up
- Standardised products

---

## Optimal Use Considerations

### Based on Current Evidence

**Timing:**
- 30-60 minutes before bed
- Consistency may matter
- Adjust based on response

**Dosing:**
- Higher doses more sedating
- 25-300mg range studied
- Individual variation
- Start lower, adjust up

### Product Considerations

- Full-spectrum may enhance (terpenes)
- Delivery method affects onset
- Quality important
- Consistency preferred

---

## Ongoing Research

### Active Clinical Trials

**Currently Registered:**
- Multiple insomnia trials
- Sleep quality studies
- Various populations
- Results pending

### Future Directions

- Larger controlled trials
- Long-term data
- Mechanism clarification
- Comparison to sleep aids

---

## My Take

CBD for sleep shows promise, particularly when anxiety contributes to sleep problems. The evidence suggests higher doses work better for sedation, and the effect may be partly through anxiety reduction. However, we need larger, longer, well-controlled trials to make confident recommendations. For now, CBD appears to be a reasonable option to try for sleep, with a favourable safety profile compared to many sleep medications.
