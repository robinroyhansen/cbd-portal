## My Take

The UAE is one of the clearest cases in the world: CBD is absolutely prohibited, and the penalties are genuinely severe. Dubai attracts millions of tourists, but its drug laws haven't softened to accommodate visitors from CBD-legal countries.

I've heard of travelers getting in serious trouble for small amounts of CBD oil forgotten in a bag. The UAE takes these laws seriously, and "I didn't know" is not a defense.

If you're planning a trip to Dubai or anywhere in the UAE, do a thorough check of all your belongings. Remove any CBD products, check supplement labels, and err on the side of caution. The consequences of getting this wrong are life-altering.
