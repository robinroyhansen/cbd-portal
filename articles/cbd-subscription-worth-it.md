## My Take

CBD subscriptions can be smart if you're a consistent user who's found their product. The savings are real, and the convenience is nice. But don't subscribe if you're still figuring out what works for you—that commitment isn't worth it yet.

Always verify the cancellation process before signing up. The best subscription programs make it genuinely easy to cancel or pause.
