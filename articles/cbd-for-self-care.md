## Key Takeaways

## My Take

Self-care isn't selfish—it's necessary. And CBD can be a wonderful part of that practice, supporting relaxation, sleep, and physical comfort. But CBD is a tool, not the whole solution.

The most meaningful self-care comes from addressing real needs—rest, boundaries, connection, professional help when needed. CBD can enhance these practices, making baths more relaxing, sleep more restorative, and recovery more complete. Use it as part of genuinely taking care of yourself.
