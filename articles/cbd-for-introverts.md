## Quick Summary

Introverts often experience social situations as draining, even enjoyable ones. CBD may help introverts manage social anxiety, recover from social interaction, and maintain energy for necessary social engagements.

## Key Takeaways

2. **Recovery support** after events
3. **Low doses** for function during
4. **Honor introversion**—CBD supports, doesn't change
5. **Part of** overall energy management

## My Take

CBD isn't going to turn an introvert into an extrovert—nor should it. Introversion is a valid way of being. But CBD can help manage the anxiety that often accompanies social requirements and support faster recovery after draining events.

Use CBD to make necessary social engagement more manageable, not to force yourself into an extroverted lifestyle. Protect your alone time and honor your needs. CBD is a support tool, not a personality changer.
