## Quick Summary

Not all CBD products are created equal. Quality varies widely in this largely unregulated market. Knowing what to look for helps you identify trustworthy products and avoid wasting money on subpar or potentially unsafe options.

---

## Essential Quality Markers

### Third-Party Lab Testing

Most important:
- Independent lab verification
- Certificate of Analysis (COA)
- Batch-specific testing
- Available to consumers

### What Labs Test

COA should include:
- Cannabinoid content (CBD, THC levels)
- Heavy metals
- Pesticides
- Residual solvents
- Microbial contamination

### Red Flag

Avoid if:
- No lab testing available
- Testing is from in-house only
- Results are outdated
- Can't access COA easily

---

## Source and Extraction

### Hemp Source

Quality indicators:
- US or EU grown hemp
- Organic preferred
- Known growing region
- Transparent sourcing

### Extraction Method

Best methods:
- CO2 extraction (cleanest)
- Ethanol extraction (effective)
- Avoid: butane or unknown methods
- Company should disclose method

---

## Product Labeling

### What Labels Should Show

Essential information:
- CBD mg per serving
- Total CBD mg in container
- Ingredients list
- Batch/lot number
- Expiration date

### Accurate Claims

Trustworthy products:
- Don't make medical claims
- Accurate CBD amounts
- Clear about THC content
- Realistic benefit descriptions

### Warning Signs

Questionable if:
- Vague CBD content ("proprietary blend")
- Health claims that seem exaggerated
- Missing ingredient list
- No batch information

---

## Company Transparency

### Good Signs

Trustworthy companies:
- Easy to contact
- Responsive customer service
- Clear about sourcing and methods
- Educational content
- Industry involvement

### Research the Brand

Check for:
- Reviews from multiple sources
- Company history
- Any FDA warning letters
- Industry reputation

---

## Price as Indicator

### Too Good to Be True

Low prices may mean:
- Lower CBD content than claimed
- Inferior hemp source
- Poor extraction methods
- No testing (cost savings)

### Reasonable Pricing

Expect to pay:
- Mid-range prices for quality
- More for full-spectrum typically
- Premium for certified organic
- Less for isolate products

### Price Per mg

Compare:
- Calculate cost per mg CBD
- Typical range: $0.05-0.20/mg
- Very low may indicate quality issues
- Very high may be marketing premium

---

## Spectrum Type Verification

### What They Claim

Verify:
- Full-spectrum should show multiple cannabinoids
- Broad-spectrum should show ND for THC
- Isolate should be 99%+ CBD
- COA confirms these claims

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Third-party testing** is non-negotiable
2. **Transparent sourcing** indicates quality commitment
3. **Clear labeling** shows professionalism
4. **Avoid** products without accessible COAs
5. **Price reflects** quality often (not always)

## My Take

In an unregulated market, the responsibility falls on you as a consumer to verify quality. The good news is that quality brands make verification easy—they want you to see their testing results and know their sourcing.

If a company makes it difficult to find third-party testing or is vague about sourcing and extraction, that tells you something. Stick with transparent brands even if they cost a bit more—you're paying for verified quality.
