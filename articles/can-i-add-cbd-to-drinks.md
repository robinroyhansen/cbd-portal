## Quick Summary

Yes, you can add CBD oil to drinks. It works best in beverages with some fat content (coffee with cream, smoothies) as CBD is fat-soluble. Regular CBD oil may not mix well with water-based drinks, while water-soluble CBD products are specifically designed for beverages.

- Blends smoothly
- No separation
- Made for beverages
