## Quick Summary

CBD lab reports (Certificates of Analysis or COAs) are your proof of product quality. Learning to read them helps you verify what you're buying. Here's how to understand these documents.

---

## What Is a COA?

### Definition

COA basics:
- Certificate of Analysis
- Independent lab testing results
- Verifies product contents
- Checks for contaminants

### Why It Matters

Importance:
- Confirms CBD content
- Shows THC level
- Reveals contaminants
- Protects you as consumer

---

## Finding the COA

### Where to Look

Access points:
- QR code on product
- Company website
- Batch number lookup
- Request from company

### What to Match

Verify:
- Batch number matches your product
- Date is recent
- Product name matches
- Lab is legitimate

---

## Key Sections of a COA

### Cannabinoid Profile

What to check:
- CBD content (mg/g or mg/ml)
- THC level (should match claims)
- Other cannabinoids present
- Total cannabinoids

### Understanding CBD Content

Reading results:
- Compare to product label claims
- Allow ±10-15% variance
- Calculate per serving
- Verify you're getting what you paid for

### THC Levels

Critical check:
- Should be ≤0.3% for legal hemp
- "ND" or "<LOQ" means below detection
- Important for drug testing concerns
- Full-spectrum will show some THC

---

## Contaminant Testing

### Heavy Metals

Look for:
- Lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium
- Results should show pass or ND
- Important safety check
- Hemp can absorb heavy metals

### Pesticides

Check:
- Common pesticide panel
- All should pass or be ND
- Especially important for non-organic
- Indicates growing practices

### Residual Solvents

Shows:
- Leftover extraction solvents
- Butane, ethanol, etc.
- Should be within safe limits
- Indicates extraction quality

### Microbial Testing

Verifies:
- No harmful bacteria
- No mold/yeast above limits
- Important for immunocompromised
- Quality production indicator

---

## Reading the Numbers

### Common Terms

Understanding:
- **ND:** Not Detected (below testing threshold)
- **LOQ:** Limit of Quantitation (lowest measurable)
- **LOD:** Limit of Detection
- **Pass/Fail:** Meets safety standards

### Unit Conversions

Common measurements:
- mg/g = milligrams per gram
- mg/ml = milligrams per milliliter
- % = percentage by weight
- ppm = parts per million (contaminants)

---

## Red Flags

### Warning Signs

Be cautious if:
- COA unavailable
- Batch number doesn't match
- Results are very old
- Lab isn't accredited
- CBD content differs greatly from label

### Fake or Questionable COAs

Watch for:
- No lab name/contact info
- Generic appearance
- No batch number
- Unprofessional formatting

---

## Verifying the Lab

### Check Legitimacy

Ensure:
- Lab is ISO-accredited
- Can verify results with lab
- Lab exists and is reputable
- Contact info is real

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always check** COA before buying
2. **Match batch numbers** to your product
3. **Verify CBD content** matches label
4. **Check THC** is within legal limits
5. **Look for contaminant** testing

---

## My Take

Reading COAs becomes second nature once you do it a few times. The most important things to verify: CBD content matches the label (within 10-15%), THC is where it should be, and contaminant tests pass.

If a company doesn't provide COAs or makes them hard to find, that's a major red flag. Quality brands want you to see this information.
