## Key Takeaways

1. **Off-duty use** only—never before work
2. **Know workplace** policies
3. **THC-free products** if drug tested
4. **Sleep and stress** management
5. **Part of** broader self-care

---

## My Take

Healthcare workers carry enormous burdens—physical, emotional, and mental. CBD can be part of managing the toll, particularly around sleep and stress recovery. But it's not a substitute for systemic changes in healthcare that workers need.

Protect your license by using only verified THC-free products and using only off-duty. Your patients need you at your best during shifts—use CBD to recover afterward, not to get through the shift.
