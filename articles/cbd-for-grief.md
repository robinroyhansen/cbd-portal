## Quick Summary

Grief is a natural response to loss, but it can be overwhelming. CBD's anxiety-reducing and sleep-supporting properties may help with some grief symptoms, though it won't speed up the grieving process itself.

## My Take

Grief is one of the hardest human experiences. While CBD can't take away the pain of loss, it may help manage some of the accompanying symptoms—the anxiety, the sleepless nights, the physical tension.

Think of CBD as one support among many during grief. It's not about avoiding the feelings—grief needs to be felt and processed. But if CBD helps you get some sleep or feel less anxious, that's valuable during an already difficult time.
