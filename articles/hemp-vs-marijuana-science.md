# Hemp vs Marijuana: The Scientific Distinction

## Quick Summary

Hemp and marijuana are both *Cannabis sativa* plants, distinguished legally by THC content: hemp contains ≤0.3% THC, while marijuana contains more. Scientifically, they're the same species—the distinction is regulatory, not botanical. Hemp is bred for fiber, seeds, and CBD, while marijuana is bred for THC. Both contain cannabinoids, but the ratios differ dramatically.

## The Botanical Reality

### Same Species
- Both are *Cannabis sativa L.*
- No scientific species distinction
- Subspecies classifications debated
- Interbreed freely
- Same plant, different cultivars

### The Term "Marijuana"
- Not a scientific term
- Political/cultural origin (1930s)
- Used to distinguish high-THC cannabis
- "Cannabis" is the scientific name

---

## The Legal Definition

### 2018 Farm Bill (USA)
**Hemp:** Cannabis with ≤0.3% THC (dry weight)
**Marijuana:** Cannabis with >0.3% THC (dry weight)

This arbitrary threshold creates the legal distinction:
- 0.29% THC = Legal hemp
- 0.31% THC = Illegal marijuana (federally)

### International Variations
| Country | Hemp THC Limit |
|---------|---------------|
| USA | 0.3% |
| EU | 0.2% (moving to 0.3%) |
| Switzerland | 1.0% |
| Canada | 0.3% (but all cannabis legal) |
| Australia | 1.0% |

---

## Chemical Differences

### Cannabinoid Profiles

| Compound | Hemp | Marijuana |
|----------|------|-----------|
| THC | <0.3% | 5-35% |
| CBD | 10-25% | 0.1-5% |
| CBG | 0.5-2% | 0.1-1% |
| CBC | Variable | Variable |
| Other | Variable | Variable |

### Why the Difference
- Selective breeding over decades
- Hemp bred for fiber, seeds, low THC
- Marijuana bred for high THC
- CBD content inversely related to THC
- Genetic selection reinforced differences

---

## The Same Plant, Different Selection

### Hemp Breeding Goals
- High fiber content
- Large seed production
- Low THC (legal compliance)
- High CBD (recent focus)
- Industrial applications

### Marijuana Breeding Goals
- High THC content
- Specific terpene profiles
- Dense flowers
- Various psychoactive effects

---

## Genetics and Chemotypes

### Chemotype Classification
Cannabis can be classified by dominant cannabinoid:

| Chemotype | Dominant | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Type I | THC | Most marijuana |
| Type II | Mixed THC/CBD | Some medical strains |
| Type III | CBD | Hemp/CBD strains |
| Type IV | CBG | Rare, emerging |
| Type V | Minimal cannabinoids | Fiber hemp |

---

## Cultivation Differences

### Hemp Cultivation
- Grown outdoors in large fields
- Minimal attention per plant
- Harvested mechanically
- Focus on biomass or seeds
- Legal in most US states

### Marijuana Cultivation
- Often indoor/greenhouse
- Individual plant attention
- Hand-trimmed flowers
- Focus on potency and quality
- Legal only in some states

---

## The 0.3% Problem

### Why This Number?
- Comes from a 1979 book by Ernest Small
- Arbitrary statistical distinction
- Not based on psychoactivity threshold
- Has no pharmacological basis

### Practical Issues
- THC can concentrate in flowers
- Same plant: 0.28% stem, 0.32% flower
- Hot hemp (>0.3%) must be destroyed
- Farmers face compliance challenges
- Testing variability adds uncertainty

---

## Legal Implications

### What 0.3% Means Practically
- Below 0.3%: Legal hemp, can be shipped, sold
- Above 0.3%: Marijuana, federal crime
- Same plant could be either depending on test

### CBD Product Source
- Legal CBD must come from hemp
- Identical CBD molecule either way
- Source matters legally, not chemically
- "Hemp-derived CBD" = legal status claim

---

## Terpene Profiles

Terpenes also differ by cultivation:

### Common Hemp Terpenes
- Myrcene (earthy)
- Caryophyllene (spicy)
- Pinene (pine)
- Generally earthier profiles

### Common Marijuana Terpenes
- More variety by strain
- Limonene (citrus) often higher
- Diverse breeding for flavor
- More distinct strain profiles

---

## Nutritional Differences

### Hemp Seeds
- Rich in protein (25%)
- Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids
- No cannabinoids in seeds
- Legal as food everywhere

### Marijuana Seeds
- Similar nutritional profile
- Less commonly consumed
- Legal status varies
- Same plant species

---

## Historical Context

### Ancient Uses
- Cannabis cultivated 10,000+ years
- Fiber, food, medicine
- High-THC varieties relatively recent
- Hemp/marijuana distinction modern

### Prohibition Era
- 1937 Marihuana Tax Act
- Lumped all cannabis together
- Hemp industry devastated
- Distinction later reintroduced

## My Take

The hemp/marijuana distinction is a legal and cultural construct, not a scientific one. As someone who works with hemp-derived CBD daily, I find it somewhat absurd that a 0.01% THC difference determines whether a product is legal medicine or Schedule I controlled substance.

That said, the distinction matters practically. Hemp-derived CBD products exist in a legal market; marijuana-derived products don't (federally). For consumers, "hemp-derived" means legal status, not superior quality or different CBD.

The science is clear: CBD is CBD regardless of source. The law is less rational.
