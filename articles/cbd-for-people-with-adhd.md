## Quick Summary

ADHD affects focus, impulse control, and executive function. Some people with ADHD use CBD for associated symptoms like anxiety, sleep problems, and restlessness. Research is limited, and CBD should not replace ADHD medications without medical guidance.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Limited research** on CBD for ADHD specifically
2. **May help** associated anxiety and sleep
3. **Doesn't replace** ADHD medication
4. **Discuss with** doctor before using
5. **Track effects** carefully if trying

---

## My Take

I'm cautious about CBD for ADHD specifically. The research isn't there to support it for core ADHD symptoms, and stimulant medications have strong evidence. Where CBD might help is with ADHD's frequent companions: anxiety, sleep problems, and evening restlessness.

If you have ADHD and are interested in CBD, talk to your prescribing doctor. Use it as a potential complement for associated symptoms, not as a replacement for proven ADHD treatments. And be aware that CBD won't help you focus the way your medication does.
