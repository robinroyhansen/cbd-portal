## CBD and Anesthesia

### Interaction Concerns

Why it matters:

### What Anesthesiologists Need to Know

Important information:

- Doses and frequency
- How recently used
- Full disclosure essential

## Bleeding Concerns

### Potential Blood Thinning

## When to Stop CBD

### General Recommendations

- Stop 1-2 weeks before surgery
- Allow clearance from system
- Follow your surgeon's specific guidance
- Don't guess—ask

### Why Advance Stopping

Reasoning:

- Metabolism varies

## Talking to Your Surgical Team

### What to Disclose

Be honest about:
- All CBD products used
- Frequency and doses
- Duration of use
- Other supplements

### Why Honesty Matters

Critical for:
- Proper anesthesia planning
- Drug interaction awareness
- Post-op medication planning
- Your safety

### Don't Hide CBD Use

Important:
- Medical team isn't judging
- They need accurate information
- Your safety depends on honesty
- CBD is legal—no shame

---

## Different Surgery Types

### Major Surgery

Higher concern:
- More complex anesthesia
- Greater bleeding risk
- More medications
- Longer stopping time likely

### Minor Procedures

Still important:
- Even minor surgeries matter
- Local anesthesia can interact
- Discuss with provider
- Don't assume it's fine

### Emergency Surgery

If no time to stop:
- Be honest about recent use
- Medical team will adapt
- Still safer than hiding it
- Emergency protocols exist

---

## Post-Surgery CBD Use

### When to Resume

After surgery:
- Ask your surgeon specifically
- After wound healing
- After stopping pain medications
- When cleared by team

### Drug Interactions Continue

Post-op concerns:
- Pain medications
- Antibiotics
- Anti-clotting medications
- Other prescriptions

---

## Pre-Surgery Anxiety

### Common Concern

Many wonder:
- Can I use CBD for pre-surgery anxiety?
- Usually no—timing too close
- Discuss alternatives with team
- Other options exist

### Alternatives

Instead consider:
- Prescribed anti-anxiety medication
- Relaxation techniques
- Medical team support
- Honest conversation about fears

---

## What CBD Won't Do

### Surgical Context

CBD doesn't:
- Replace medical anxiety management
- Override surgical guidelines
- Make surgery safer
- Justify hiding use

### Medical Team Priority

Trust that:
- They want your best outcome
- Guidelines exist for safety
- Your honesty helps them
- They have alternatives

## Key Takeaways

1. **Tell your surgical team** about CBD use
2. **Stop CBD** when advised (usually 1-2 weeks)
3. **Anesthesia interactions** are real
4. **Bleeding concerns** exist
5. **Honesty** is essential for safety

---

## My Take

Surgery is not the time to gamble with drug interactions. CBD's effects on anesthesia and bleeding are real concerns, and your surgical team needs complete information to keep you safe.

I know stopping CBD before surgery can be challenging if you rely on it for pain or anxiety. But the risk of complications from undisclosed use is far greater than the discomfort of a brief break. Be honest with your medical team—they'll help you manage the pre-surgery period without CBD.
