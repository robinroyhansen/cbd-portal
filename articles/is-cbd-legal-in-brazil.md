## Quick Answer

CBD is **legal in Brazil for medical use** with proper authorization. Since 2019, ANVISA (Brazil's health regulatory agency) has allowed CBD products for medical purposes. Products must be registered or imported with authorization. There is no recreational or general wellness CBD market.

## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD is prescription-only** in Brazil

3. **Medical authorization required**
4. **Personal import possible** with approval
5. **No OTC market** exists
6. **Do not bring CBD** when traveling to Brazil

## My Take

Brazil has moved forward on medical CBD, but access remains complicated compared to countries with OTC markets. The prescription requirement and ANVISA authorization process create barriers that make casual use difficult.

For Brazilians with genuine medical needs, the system works—doctors can prescribe, and products are available. It just takes more effort than walking into a health food store.

For visitors, don't bring CBD to Brazil and don't expect to easily access it. The system isn't designed for tourism or casual use.
