## Using CBD for Headaches

### Preventive Use

Approach:

### Acute Use

During headache:
- Sublingual for faster effect
- May reduce intensity
- Not instant relief
- Combined with other measures

### Dosing

Suggestions:

## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD may help** some types of headaches
2. **Tension headaches** most likely to respond
3. **Research is limited** but mechanisms plausible
4. **Daily use** for prevention, acute use for relief
5. **Not instant cure** — patience needed
6. **Part of overall approach** to headache management

## My Take

Headaches are tricky because they have so many causes. CBD's anti-inflammatory and stress-reducing properties make it reasonable for tension headaches and stress-related head pain. For migraines, the evidence is less clear.

If you're trying CBD for headaches, I'd suggest consistent daily use rather than just reaching for it when a headache strikes. The preventive approach—reducing overall inflammation and stress—may be more effective than acute treatment.
