## Quick Summary

Eye strain from screens is increasingly common in our digital world. While CBD won't fix tired eyes directly, its anti-inflammatory properties and ability to promote relaxation may support relief from eye strain symptoms, particularly tension and headaches associated with prolonged screen use.

## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD may help** secondary symptoms like tension and headaches
2. **Won't fix** eye strain directly
3. **Lifestyle changes** more important
4. **Never put CBD** in or near eyes
5. **See eye doctor** for persistent issues

---

## My Take

Eye strain is really a lifestyle problem in our screen-dominated world. CBD can help with the secondary effects—the tension headaches, neck strain from poor posture, and stress—but it won't fix your eyes or make unlimited screen time okay.

The 20-20-20 rule, proper ergonomics, and regular breaks will do more for eye strain than any supplement. Think of CBD as supporting relief from the tension and headaches that accompany eye strain, not as an eye strain treatment itself.
