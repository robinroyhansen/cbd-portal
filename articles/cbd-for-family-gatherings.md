## My Take

Family gatherings are complicated precisely because we care. The stress comes from wanting connection while navigating difficult dynamics. CBD can help you stay regulated enough to respond rather than react, potentially preventing escalation you'd regret.

But CBD isn't a magic solution for family dysfunction. It helps you manage your own responses; it doesn't change anyone else. Sometimes the best approach is accepting that some gatherings will be difficult and having tools (like CBD) to survive them with your wellbeing intact.
