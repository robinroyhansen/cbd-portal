## Quick Answer

Pinene is a [terpene](/knowledge/what-are-terpenes) with a distinctive pine and forest aroma. It exists in two forms: alpha-pinene and beta-pinene. As one of the most common terpenes in nature, pinene is associated with alertness, memory support, and anti-inflammatory effects. It may counteract some sedating effects of other cannabis compounds.

## My Take

Pinene represents the "wake up" end of the terpene spectrum. In contrast to myrcene's relaxing effects, pinene-dominant products tend to feel clearer and more focused. If you've ever wondered why some CBD products leave you feeling foggy while others don't, terpene profiles—particularly the pinene-to-myrcene ratio—play a significant role. For daytime productivity, I look for products with meaningful pinene content.
