## Quick Summary

If you have allergies, CBD products require careful ingredient scrutiny. While CBD itself is unlikely to cause allergic reactions, CBD products contain carrier oils, flavourings, and other ingredients that may trigger sensitivities. People with coconut allergies should avoid MCT oil carriers; those with plant allergies should check for terpenes and botanical additives. Always read ingredient lists carefully and start with pure, minimal-ingredient products.

## My Take

Having allergies doesn't mean you can't use CBD—it means you need to be more careful about product selection. CBD itself is rarely an allergen; it's the other ingredients that usually cause problems. If you're allergy-prone, start with the simplest product possible: pure CBD isolate in a single carrier oil with no flavourings. Check every ingredient, do a patch test for topicals, and introduce new products cautiously. Many people with allergies use CBD successfully by choosing products carefully.
