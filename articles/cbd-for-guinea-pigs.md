## Quick Answer

CBD for guinea pigs has **no established safety profile or dosing guidelines**. Guinea pigs are small herbivores with sensitive digestive systems that differ significantly from dogs and cats. While they likely have an endocannabinoid system, no research exists on CBD effects in guinea pigs. Consult an exotic veterinarian before considering any supplementation.

## What We Know (Very Little)

### Research Status
- Zero clinical studies on CBD in guinea pigs
- No established safe dosage
- No published case reports
- Extrapolating from other species unreliable

### Guinea Pig Specifics
- Small body size (700-1200g)
- Strict herbivore (no fat digestion like carnivores)
- Vitamin C dependent (like humans, unlike most animals)
- Sensitive GI system (hindgut fermenters)

---

## Potential Concerns

### Digestive Sensitivity
- Guinea pig gut relies on fiber fermentation
- Oils may disrupt gut flora
- GI stasis is serious in guinea pigs
- Carrier oils in CBD products are unfamiliar to their system

### Size and Dosing
- Average guinea pig: ~1kg
- Products designed for 10+ kg animals
- Accurate micro-dosing extremely difficult
- Very small margin for error

### Vitamin C Interaction
- Guinea pigs require dietary vitamin C
- Unknown if CBD affects vitamin C metabolism
- Unique among common pets

## Why Owners Ask About CBD

Common concerns:
- Arthritis in older guinea pigs
- Pain from bumblefoot or injuries
- Anxiety (social animals, may stress alone)
- Respiratory issues

**Better approach:** Consult an exotic vet for proper diagnosis and treatment.

## Alternatives for Common Conditions

### For Pain/Arthritis
- Pain medications from exotic vet (meloxicam often used)
- Environmental modifications (low-entry hideouts, ramps)
- Soft bedding
- Weight management

### For Anxiety
- Companion guinea pig (they're social!)
- Proper cage size and enrichment
- Consistent routine
- Reduced handling stress

### For General Health
- Unlimited timothy hay
- Fresh vegetables (vitamin C sources)
- Fresh water
- Regular exotic vet checkups

---

## If You're Considering CBD

### Essential Steps
1. Consult an exotic/small mammal veterinarian
2. Get proper diagnosis of any condition
3. Try proven treatments first
4. Understand there's no safety data

### Expect Cautious Advice
Most exotic vets will likely advise against CBD because:
- No safety studies exist
- Effective alternatives available
- Small size increases risk
- Unknown GI effects in herbivores

---

## Warning Signs to Watch

If CBD is ever given (not recommended):
- Any appetite decrease (serious in guinea pigs)
- Reduced fecal output
- Lethargy
- Breathing changes
- Behavioral changes
- GI stasis signs

**Any concerning sign = immediate exotic vet visit.**

## My Position

I must be clear: **I don't recommend CBD for guinea pigs.**

We have no data, and guinea pigs are fragile animals with specialized needs. Their herbivore digestive system may not handle carrier oils well, and their small size makes dosing dangerous.

If your guinea pig has health issues, please work with an exotic veterinarian who understands these unique animals. They have access to medications actually tested in guinea pigs and similar species.
