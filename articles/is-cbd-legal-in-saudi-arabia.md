## My Take

This is one of the clearest "no" situations globally. Saudi Arabia maintains strict prohibition on all cannabis products, and the penalties are among the harshest in the world. There is absolutely no scenario where bringing CBD to Saudi Arabia is advisable.

If you use CBD regularly and are traveling to Saudi Arabia, plan to go without for the duration of your trip. Do not attempt to bring any products, regardless of THC content or labeling.
