## Quick Summary

Verifying CBD quality requires checking third-party lab reports (COAs), researching the brand's reputation, examining product labelling, and assessing the company's transparency. A quality CBD product should have current, comprehensive testing from an independent lab that confirms CBD content matches the label and shows absence of contaminants.

## Key Takeaways

- Third-party testing is essential
- Lab reports should be current and comprehensive
- Compare stated content to tested content
- Check for contaminant testing
- Research brand reputation

## The Gold Standard: Third-Party Testing

### What It Means

**Third-Party Testing:**
- Independent laboratory
- Not affiliated with the brand
- Objective analysis
- Published results

### Why It Matters

- Confirms actual CBD content
- Verifies safety
- Identifies contaminants
- Builds trust

## Reading Lab Reports (COAs)

### Essential Tests

**Cannabinoid Potency:**
- CBD content matches label (±10%)
- THC within legal limits (<0.2% or <0.3%)
- Other cannabinoids if full-spectrum

**Contaminant Testing:**
- Pesticides (must pass)
- Heavy metals (must pass)
- Residual solvents (must pass)
- Microbial (must pass)

### Red Flags in COAs

- Missing tests
- Old dates (>12 months)
- In-house testing only
- Batch number doesn't match
- Failed tests

## Step-by-Step Verification

### Step 1: Find the COA

**Where to Look:**
- QR code on product

### Step 2: Check the Date

**Should Be:**

### Step 3: Match the Batch

**Verify:**

- Specific to your product

### Step 4: Review Cannabinoid Content

**Confirm:**

- THC is within legal limits
- Results make sense

### Step 5: Check Contaminant Results

**All Should Show:**

## My Take

Verification isn't optional—it's essential. Any reputable CBD brand should make quality verification easy. If you can't find lab reports, can't match batch numbers, or can't research the company, walk away. The extra few minutes spent verifying saves you from wasting money on ineffective or potentially unsafe products. Quality CBD exists; you just need to confirm you're getting it.
