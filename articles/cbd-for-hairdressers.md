## Key Takeaways

## My Take

Hairdressing is physically demanding in ways often underestimated—the repetitive motions, standing, and raised arm positions create significant strain. Many stylists develop chronic pain or have shortened careers due to physical issues.

CBD topicals can support the daily recovery that makes this work sustainable. The key is consistent use—before, during, and after shifts—combined with proper ergonomics and stretching. Invest in your body now for a longer, healthier career.
