## Key Evaluation Criteria

- Customer service accessible

**Red flag:** Vague about operations

### 3. Accurate Labeling

**Should match:**

- Serving sizes sensible
- No misleading claims

**Red flag:** Inconsistent information

### 4. Reputation

**Research:**
- Customer reviews (multiple sources)
- Industry recognition
- Years in business
- How they handle complaints

**Red flag:** Many negative reviews or no track record

## Quality Indicators

### Hemp Source

**Better options:**
- Organic hemp
- US/EU grown (known regulations)
- Single-source or traceable
- Pesticide-free

### Extraction Method

**Preferred:**
- CO2 extraction (cleanest)
- Ethanol extraction (acceptable)
- Avoid unknown methods
- Should be disclosed

### Product Range

**Good signs:**
- Appropriate variety
- Different strengths
- Clear formulations
- Not claiming to cure everything

## Testing to Verify

### What COAs Should Show

**Potency:**
- CBD content accurate
- THC content verified
- Other cannabinoids (if full-spectrum)

**Safety:**
- Heavy metals
- Pesticides
- Residual solvents
- Microbial contaminants

### How to Read COAs

Steps:
1. Find on company website
2. Match batch number to product
3. Verify CBD matches label
4. Check THC is compliant
5. Review contaminant results

## Warning Signs

### Avoid Brands That

- Make disease cure claims
- Have no testing available
- Are much cheaper than competitors
- Have vague ingredient lists
- Can't provide COAs when requested
- Have no customer service

### Price Considerations

**Too cheap:**
- Likely quality issues
- May be mislabeled
- Could contain contaminants

**Reasonable range:**
- $0.05-0.15 per mg CBD
- Quality costs something
- Very cheap = very suspicious

## Research Process

### Before Buying

1. Check for COAs on website
2. Review customer feedback
3. Research company history
4. Verify claims are reasonable
5. Compare to alternatives

### Questions to Ask

- Where is your hemp sourced?
- What extraction method?
- Can I see third-party test results?
- What's your return policy?

## Key Takeaways

1. **Third-party testing** is non-negotiable
2. **Transparency** about sourcing and methods
3. **Verify claims** match reality
4. **Check reputation** through multiple sources
5. **Avoid too-cheap** products
6. **COAs should be accessible**

## My Take

The CBD market has matured, and quality brands have emerged. But there are still poor products out there. Taking a few minutes to verify testing and research a brand saves you money and ensures you get something that actually works.

The best brands are transparent because they have nothing to hide. If a company makes it hard to find testing results or is vague about their operations, that's a red flag.
