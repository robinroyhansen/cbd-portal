## My Take

First responders deal with things most people never see, and the toll on mental health is real. CBD may be a useful tool for stress and sleep—but only if your department permits it.

The most important thing: check your policy. Don't risk your career without knowing the rules. If CBD is permitted, use THC-free products and be smart about timing.

And if you're struggling, please seek professional help. CBD supports wellness; it doesn't treat trauma.
