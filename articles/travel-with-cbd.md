## My Take

Travel with CBD requires more preparation than most people expect. My honest advice: if travelling internationally, seriously consider leaving CBD at home unless you've thoroughly verified it's legal at your destination. The risk of customs issues, confiscation, or worse simply isn't worth it in many cases. For domestic travel, keeping original packaging, having your COA accessible, and following liquid rules usually makes things straightforward. When in doubt, don't bring it.
