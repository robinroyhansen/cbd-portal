## My Take

Quality CBD isn't cheap to produce—testing, extraction, compliance all cost real money. But some brands definitely overcharge for marketing and packaging rather than quality. Calculate the cost per mg, compare to reputable brands, and look for value without sacrificing quality. Prices are coming down as the industry matures.
