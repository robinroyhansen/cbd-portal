## Key Takeaways

1. **Suppositories bypass** digestive system
2. **Alternative route** when oral isn't optimal
3. **May help** pelvic region conditions
4. **Less common** but valid delivery method
5. **Quality and storage** matter

## My Take

CBD suppositories aren't for everyone, but they serve real purposes. For people who can't take oral CBD due to nausea, digestive issues, or absorption problems, suppositories offer an alternative. For pelvic region conditions, they may provide more targeted delivery.

If standard oral or sublingual CBD works well for you, there's probably no reason to switch to suppositories. But if you're having issues with other delivery methods, they're worth knowing about as an option.
