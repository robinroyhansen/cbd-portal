## Quick Summary

Post-workout recovery determines how well you adapt to training. CBD may support the recovery process through anti-inflammatory effects, sleep support, and stress reduction—helping you get more from your workouts.

---

## Why Post-Workout Matters

### Adaptation Happens During Recovery

Key concept:
- Training creates stimulus
- Recovery creates adaptation
- Poor recovery = poor results
- CBD supports recovery phase

### Recovery Challenges

Common issues:
- Excessive inflammation
- Poor sleep despite fatigue
- Muscle soreness (DOMS)
- Stress affecting recovery

---

## How CBD Supports Recovery

### Inflammation Management

After training:
- Exercise causes inflammation
- Some inflammation necessary
- Excessive inflammation problematic
- CBD modulates (doesn't eliminate)

### Sleep Quality

Critical for gains:
- Growth hormone during sleep
- Muscle repair during rest
- Training can disrupt sleep
- CBD supports quality rest

### Stress Response

Nervous system:
- Hard training is stress
- Chronic stress impairs recovery
- CBD helps shift to parasympathetic
- Better recovery state

---

## Post-Workout CBD Protocol

### Timing

When to take:
- Within 1-2 hours post-workout
- Evening dose before bed
- Both if possible
- Consistency matters

### Dosing

Typical approach:
- 25-40mg post-workout
- Higher after intense sessions
- Sleep-focused evening dose
- Adjust based on training load

### Delivery Methods

Options:
- Systemic (oil, capsule) for overall
- Topical for specific muscles
- Combine for best effect
- Post-workout shake inclusion

## What CBD Won't Do

### Realistic Expectations

CBD doesn't:
- Build muscle
- Burn fat
- Replace nutrition
- Substitute for sleep
- Eliminate all soreness

### Still Essential

You need:
- Proper training
- Adequate protein
- Sufficient calories
- Quality sleep
- Adequate rest days

---

## Specific Training Types

### Strength Training

Focus:
- Muscle recovery
- Higher inflammation
- Systemic + topical
- Sleep crucial for growth

### Endurance Training

Focus:
- Prolonged inflammation
- Higher training volumes
- Consistent CBD use
- Sleep for adaptation

### HIIT

Focus:
- Acute stress recovery
- Nervous system recovery
- Both systemic and sleep
- CNS support

---

## Product Selection

### For Post-Workout

Best options:
- Fast-absorbing tinctures
- Capsules for convenience
- Recovery-specific products
- Quality matters

### Topical Addition

Targeted use:
- Apply to worked muscles
- After showering
- Multiple applications okay
- Complements systemic

---

## Combining with Other Recovery

### CBD Plus

Synergistic approaches:
- Protein intake
- Hydration
- Sleep hygiene
- Active recovery/mobility

### Timing Post-Workout

Sample protocol:
1. Workout ends
2. Protein + CBD (within 30-60 min)
3. Hydration
4. Light activity/stretching
5. Evening CBD for sleep

---

## Competition Considerations

### Drug Testing

If competing:
- CBD generally allowed
- THC prohibited
- Use THC-free products
- Verify with third-party testing

### Organizations

Check rules:
- WADA allows CBD
- THC still prohibited
- Organization-specific rules
- Verify before competing

## Key Takeaways

1. **Recovery is where** adaptation happens
2. **CBD supports** inflammation management
3. **Sleep support** may be biggest benefit
4. **Post-workout + evening** dosing optimal
5. **Combine with** nutrition and rest

---

## My Take

CBD fits well into a post-workout recovery routine, particularly for managing the inflammation and sleep disruption that can follow hard training. It won't replace proper nutrition, rest, or training, but it supports the recovery process that makes training effective.

The biggest benefit for many athletes is sleep support. Training hard then sleeping poorly is counterproductive. CBD helps you get the quality rest where adaptation actually happens.
