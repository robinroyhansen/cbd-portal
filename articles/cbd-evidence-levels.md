## Quick Summary

Evidence for CBD varies dramatically by condition. Epilepsy has the strongest evidence (FDA-approved medication). Anxiety and pain have moderate evidence with promising trials. Many other conditions have limited or insufficient evidence. Understanding evidence levels helps set realistic expectations and make informed decisions.

## Our Evidence Rating System

We rate evidence on a 5-point scale:

| Level | Symbol | Criteria |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Strong** | ●●●●● | 20+ studies, 3+ RCTs or meta-analysis, 200+ participants |
| **Moderate** | ●●●○○ | 10-20 studies, 1-2 RCTs, 5+ human studies |
| **Limited** | ●●○○○ | 5-10 studies, no RCTs, mostly animal |
| **Insufficient** | ●○○○○ | <5 studies, only animal/in-vitro |
| **Concerning** | ⚠ | Evidence suggests caution or potential harm |

## Evidence by Condition Category

### Strong Evidence (●●●●●)

**Epilepsy (certain types)**
- FDA-approved: Epidiolex for Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes
- Multiple Phase 3 trials completed
- Reduction in seizures: 30-40% on average
- Mechanism: Multiple pathways including sodium channels

### Moderate Evidence (●●●○○)

**Anxiety Disorders**
- Multiple controlled trials showing benefit
- Social anxiety most studied
- Doses typically 300-600mg in trials
- More research needed for generalization

**Chronic Pain**
- Mixed results depending on pain type
- Neuropathic pain: Better evidence
- Combined with THC (Sativex): Stronger evidence
- Pure CBD: Promising but needs more trials

**Sleep Disorders**
- Several studies show improvement
- May work partly through anxiety reduction
- Dose-dependent (higher doses more sedating)
- Long-term efficacy needs more study

**Multiple Sclerosis Symptoms**
- Nabiximols (CBD+THC) approved in some countries
- Spasticity: Good evidence
- Pain: Moderate evidence
- Pure CBD less studied than combinations

### Limited Evidence (●●○○○)

**Depression**
- Animal studies promising
- Few human trials
- May work through serotonin receptor (5-HT1A)
- More research needed

**Inflammatory Conditions**
- Strong preclinical anti-inflammatory data
- Limited clinical trials
- Arthritis: Some positive trials
- IBD: Mixed results

**Addiction/Substance Use**
- Preliminary human studies encouraging
- Opioid craving reduction seen
- Cannabis use disorder studies ongoing
- Promising area needing more research

**Schizophrenia**
- Interesting early trials
- May have antipsychotic properties
- Different mechanism than typical antipsychotics
- Needs larger confirmatory studies

### Insufficient Evidence (●○○○○)

**Cancer Treatment**
- Preclinical only for cancer itself
- Symptom management has some evidence
- No human trials showing tumor reduction
- Do not use as cancer treatment

**Cardiovascular Conditions**
- Blood pressure reduction seen in some studies
- Mostly short-term, single-dose studies
- Long-term cardiovascular effects unknown
- More research needed

**Neurodegenerative Diseases**
- Alzheimer's: Preclinical only
- Parkinson's: Very limited human data
- Mechanisms plausible but unproven
- Not recommended as treatment

**Skin Conditions**
- Acne: Promising in-vitro only
- Eczema/Psoriasis: Very limited
- Topical applications understudied
- Needs clinical trials

### Concerning Evidence (⚠)

**Glaucoma**
- CBD may increase intraocular pressure
- Does NOT work like THC for this condition
- Not recommended for glaucoma
- May be harmful

## How Evidence Develops

Typical research progression:

```
In-Vitro Studies (cells) →
Animal Studies (mice/rats) →
Phase 1 Trials (safety) →
Phase 2 Trials (efficacy) →
Phase 3 Trials (confirmation) →
Approval/Strong Evidence
```

Most conditions are stuck somewhere in the early-middle stages.

## What Evidence Level Means for You

### Strong Evidence
- CBD is proven effective for this specific use
- Medical supervision available
- Dosing guidelines exist
- Reasonable to try under guidance

### Moderate Evidence
- CBD may help
- Worth discussing with healthcare provider
- Results may vary
- Set realistic expectations

### Limited Evidence
- CBD might help, but unclear
- Essentially self-experimentation
- May or may not see benefit
- Don't rely on it for serious conditions

### Insufficient Evidence
- No meaningful evidence yet
- We genuinely don't know if it helps
- Don't assume it works
- Consider other options first

### Concerning Evidence
- Evidence suggests potential problems
- Avoid for this condition
- Discuss with healthcare provider before using

## Evidence Quality Factors

When we assess evidence, we consider:

**Study Design**
- RCT vs observational
- Placebo-controlled
- Blinding quality

**Sample Size**
- Larger studies more reliable
- Small studies prone to error

**Replication**
- Multiple studies showing similar results
- Independent research groups

**Publication Quality**
- Peer-reviewed journals
- Declared conflicts of interest
- Full data transparency

## My Take

Evidence levels matter because they help manage expectations. I've seen too many people expect miracles from CBD for conditions where we have almost no evidence, then conclude CBD "doesn't work" when it doesn't cure their condition.

The honest truth: CBD has strong evidence for specific seizure disorders and moderate evidence for anxiety, some pain types, and sleep. For most other conditions, we're still gathering data. This doesn't mean CBD can't help—it means we don't know yet.

I encourage people to try CBD for conditions with at least moderate evidence, while maintaining realistic expectations. For conditions with insufficient evidence, don't make CBD your only strategy.
