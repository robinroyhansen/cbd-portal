## Quick Answer

CBD occupies a **legal grey area in Spain**. While hemp cultivation is legal and CBD products are widely sold, technically CBD can only be sold for "external use" or as a collector's item—not for human consumption. Despite this, Spain has a thriving CBD market with products openly available in stores and online.

## Legal Status Overview

### The Complicated Reality

Spain's CBD situation is contradictory:
- Hemp cultivation is legal (EU regulations)
- CBD extraction is legal
- CBD cosmetics are legal
- CBD for internal consumption is technically restricted
- Yet CBD oils and edibles are openly sold

### Why This Contradiction Exists

The Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products (AEMPS) hasn't approved CBD as a food supplement. Products sold as food or supplements technically violate regulations, but enforcement is minimal.

## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD is available** despite unclear legal status
2. **Technical restrictions** on internal consumption exist but aren't enforced
3. **Products widely sold** in shops throughout Spain

5. **Cosmetics and external use** products clearly legal
6. **CBD flowers available** as "aromatic" products

---

## My Take

Spain presents an interesting case—technically restrictive on paper, but practically permissive in reality. The CBD market operates openly, and you'll find shops in any major city.

For visitors and residents, quality CBD products are readily available. The key is buying from reputable sources with proper lab testing. Avoid anything without clear documentation of THC content.

The legal ambiguity might seem concerning, but in practice, it hasn't prevented a thriving market. Just be aware that products are often labeled "for external use" even when clearly intended otherwise—this is the market's way of navigating the regulatory grey zone.

If buying CBD in Spain, Barcelona and Madrid offer the best selection and most established shops.
