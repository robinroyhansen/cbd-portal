## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does limonene give you energy?

Limonene is associated with uplifting rather than sedating effects. Many users report feeling more alert and positive with limonene-rich products. However, it won't provide stimulant-like energy—think "brightening" rather than "energising."

### Can I smell limonene in CBD products?

Yes, limonene has a distinctive citrus scent. If your CBD product smells like oranges or lemons, it likely contains significant limonene. However, many products are flavoured, which can mask or mimic terpene aromas.

### Is limonene good for anxiety?

Research suggests limonene may have anti-anxiety properties. Animal studies consistently show anxiolytic effects, and some human aromatherapy research supports mood benefits. It may be particularly useful for those who find sedating terpenes too calming for daytime use.

### How much limonene is in CBD products?

Terpene content varies widely. Full-spectrum products typically contain 0.1-2% total terpenes, with limonene being a portion of that. Check the COA for specific percentages. Products marketed for mood or daytime use often emphasise limonene content.

## My Take

Limonene is my favourite terpene for daytime CBD use. Its uplifting quality complements CBD's calming effects beautifully—you get the anxiety relief without feeling drowsy. If you're exploring CBD for stress or mood support during work hours, seeking products with higher limonene content is a smart strategy. The citrus scent is also simply pleasant, making the CBD experience more enjoyable.
