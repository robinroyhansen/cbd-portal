## My Take

Malaysia's drug laws are not to be taken lightly. The mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking above certain thresholds makes this one of the highest-stakes jurisdictions in the world. While CBD possession might not trigger death penalty thresholds, it can certainly result in lengthy prison sentences.

If you're traveling to Malaysia, remove every trace of CBD from your belongings. Check everything multiple times. This is not a country where you want to find a forgotten CBD gummy at the bottom of your bag.

The potential consequences—years in prison or worse—are simply not worth any risk. Plan your trip knowing you'll be without CBD for its duration.
