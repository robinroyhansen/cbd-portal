## Quick Summary

Yes, CBD products have been recalled, though not as systematically as regulated pharmaceuticals or food products. Recalls typically involve contamination, mislabelling, undisclosed THC, or unsafe ingredients. The unregulated nature of much of the CBD market means recalls are less frequent than they should be, making consumer vigilance essential.

## My Take

CBD recalls happen, but the system is imperfect. Because regulation is inconsistent, recalls are less systematic than with pharmaceuticals or traditional food products. This puts more responsibility on consumers. Your best protection is buying from reputable brands with third-party testing and staying aware of recall notices. If you hear about a recall, take it seriously—don't assume your batch is fine.
