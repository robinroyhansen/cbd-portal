## My Take

Valencene isn't a terpene I encounter often in cannabis products, but when present, it adds a lovely fresh citrus quality that's immediately recognizable. For CBD products marketed with orange or citrus flavors, checking whether the valencene is naturally present or added can indicate product quality. Either way, the pleasant taste and potential anti-inflammatory benefits make it a welcome component.
