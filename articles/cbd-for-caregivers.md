## My Take

Caregiving is one of the most demanding things a person can do. The combination of physical labor, emotional weight, and chronic stress takes a severe toll on caregivers' health.

CBD can be part of a self-care routine, helping with stress and sleep. But it's not enough alone. Caregivers need real support—respite care, help from others, sometimes professional support. Don't try to do it all alone, and don't feel guilty about caring for yourself.
