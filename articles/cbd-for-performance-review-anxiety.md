## Key Takeaways

1. **Review anxiety is common** at all levels
2. **CBD may help** reduce anticipatory stress
3. **Enables constructive** engagement with feedback
4. **Time it properly** (45-60 minutes before)
5. **Prepare thoroughly** — anxiety management isn't enough

## My Take

Performance reviews can feel high-stakes even when you've done good work. The anxiety often prevents people from engaging constructively with feedback. CBD might help you stay calm enough to actually hear what's being said and respond thoughtfully rather than defensively.

Remember: being less anxious doesn't mean being unprepared. Do your homework on accomplishments and goals, then let CBD help with the emotional side.
