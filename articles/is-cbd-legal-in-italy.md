## Quick Answer

CBD is **legal in Italy** with products containing less than 0.5% THC (higher than most EU countries). Italy has a well-established "cannabis light" market with products sold in dedicated shops, tobacco stores, and online. The 2016 hemp law created favorable conditions, though some regulatory uncertainty remains.

## My Take

Italy offers one of Europe's most accessible CBD markets. The "cannabis light" phenomenon created widespread availability, and you'll find shops in virtually every Italian city.

The 0.5% THC limit is notably more permissive than the 0.2% standard in most EU countries, giving Italian products a bit more flexibility—though this also means they may not comply with stricter regulations if you're traveling elsewhere.

For quality, stick to established brands with clear lab testing. The market has matured significantly since the early days, and legitimate operations now dominate over the questionable products that appeared during the initial boom.

Whether you're a resident or visitor, finding CBD in Italy is straightforward. The combination of dedicated shops, tobacco store availability, and strong online presence means options are everywhere.
