## Key Takeaways

2. **Topical + oral** combination most effective
3. **Physical therapy** essential alongside
4. **Sleep support** important benefit
5. **Patience required**—no quick fix exists

## My Take

Frozen shoulder tests patience like few conditions can. The slow progression and long recovery make any relief valuable. CBD can help manage the pain and sleep disruption that accompany this condition, making the journey more bearable.

But understand that CBD won't speed up frozen shoulder recovery—nothing really does. The condition progresses through its stages regardless. What CBD can do is help you manage pain, sleep better, and cope with the frustration of a condition that takes its own time to resolve.
