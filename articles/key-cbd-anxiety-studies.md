## Quick Summary

Human clinical research on CBD for anxiety shows promising results, with several key studies demonstrating anxiolytic effects in various contexts including social anxiety, generalised anxiety, and public speaking. While evidence is growing, most studies are small and short-term.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Multiple human studies show anxiety reduction
- Public speaking model frequently used
- Social anxiety disorder well-studied
- Doses vary widely (25-600mg)
- More large-scale trials needed

## Landmark Studies

### Bergamaschi et al. (2011)

**Study Details:**
- Condition: Social anxiety disorder
- Design: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
- Participants: 24 (12 SAD patients, 12 healthy controls)
- Dose: 600mg CBD single dose
- Challenge: Simulated public speaking

**Key Findings:**
- CBD significantly reduced anxiety
- Lower cognitive impairment
- Decreased discomfort in speech
- Similar to healthy controls

**Significance:**
- First RCT in social anxiety
- Objective and subjective measures
- Established proof of concept

### Crippa et al. (2011)

**Study Details:**
- Condition: Social anxiety disorder
- Design: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover
- Participants: 10 SAD patients
- Dose: 400mg CBD
- Measure: Brain imaging (SPECT)

**Key Findings:**
- Reduced subjective anxiety
- Brain blood flow changes
- Limbic and paralimbic effects
- Neurobiological confirmation

**Significance:**
- First to show brain changes
- Mechanism insight
- Objective confirmation

## Public Speaking Studies

### Zuardi et al. (1993) - Early Research

**Study Details:**
- Design: Double-blind, crossover
- Participants: Healthy volunteers
- Doses: Various
- Challenge: Simulated public speaking

**Key Findings:**
- CBD reduced anxiety vs placebo
- Inverted U-shaped dose response
- Foundation for later research

### Linares et al. (2019)

**Study Details:**
- Design: Double-blind, randomised
- Participants: 57 healthy males
- Doses: 150mg, 300mg, 600mg CBD vs placebo
- Challenge: Simulated public speaking

**Key Findings:**
- 300mg significantly reduced anxiety
- 150mg and 600mg less effective
- Inverted U dose-response confirmed
- Peak effect at intermediate dose

**Significance:**
- Dose-response clarification
- Optimal dose guidance
- Larger than earlier studies

## Generalised Anxiety Research

### Shannon et al. (2019)

**Study Details:**
- Design: Case series
- Participants: 72 adults
- Condition: Anxiety and/or poor sleep
- Dose: 25-175mg/day (usually 25mg)
- Duration: 3 months

**Key Findings:**
- Anxiety decreased in 79.2% first month
- Sustained improvement
- Sleep also improved
- Well-tolerated

**Limitations:**
- Not placebo-controlled
- Retrospective chart review
- Real-world but less controlled

### Masataka (2019)

**Study Details:**
- Design: Double-blind, randomised
- Participants: 37 Japanese teenagers
- Condition: Social anxiety
- Dose: 300mg CBD
- Duration: 4 weeks

**Key Findings:**
- Significant anxiety reduction
- Effects similar to paroxetine literature
- Younger population studied

## PTSD-Related Research

### Elms et al. (2019)

**Study Details:**
- Design: Retrospective case series
- Participants: 11 PTSD patients
- Setting: Psychiatric outpatient
- Duration: 8 weeks

**Key Findings:**
- 91% had symptom reduction
- Decreased PTSD Checklist scores
- Generally well-tolerated
- Open-label limitations

---

## Neuroimaging Studies

### Fusar-Poli et al. (2009)

**Study Details:**
- Design: Double-blind, placebo-controlled
- Participants: 15 healthy volunteers
- Dose: 600mg CBD
- Measure: fMRI during fearful faces

**Key Findings:**
- Altered amygdala and cingulate response
- Changed limbic processing
- Mechanism insight
- Brain-based evidence

---

## Meta-Analyses and Reviews

### Skelley et al. (2020)

**Analysis:**
- Reviewed human anxiety studies
- Mixed quality assessment
- Concluded evidence promising
- Called for larger trials

### Black et al. (2019)

**Systematic Review:**
- Cannabinoids for mental disorders
- CBD evidence highlighted
- Quality limitations noted
- Positive signal identified

## Doses Used Across Studies

### Overview

| Study | Dose | Outcome |
|-------|------|---------|
| Bergamaschi | 600mg | Effective |
| Crippa | 400mg | Effective |
| Linares | 300mg optimal | Effective |
| Shannon | 25-175mg | Effective |
| Masataka | 300mg | Effective |

### Dose Observations

- Wide range studied
- 300-600mg common in acute studies
- Lower doses may work for maintenance
- Individual variation significant

---

## Current Limitations

### Research Gaps

- Small sample sizes typically
- Short durations mostly
- Various anxiety types lumped
- Different populations needed
- Long-term data lacking

### What's Needed

- Large-scale RCTs
- Longer duration studies
- Head-to-head with standard treatments
- Specific disorder studies
- Diverse populations

## My Take

The human evidence for CBD reducing anxiety is among the strongest in the CBD literature outside of epilepsy. Multiple controlled studies show effects, with the 300mg dose appearing optimal for acute anxiety. However, we still need larger, longer trials before CBD can be recommended as a standard treatment. The current evidence supports CBD as a promising option worth discussing with healthcare providers.
