## Key Takeaways

2. **Low doses** during work (if at all)
3. **Recovery use** more reliable
4. **Individual response** varies widely
5. **Not a creativity** substitute

## My Take

Creativity is personal, and so is CBD's effect on creative work. Some creatives find it helps quiet the inner critic and access flow; others find it dulls the edge they need.

Start with recovery use—that's consistently helpful. CBD supports better sleep and stress management, which makes you more creative the next day. During-work use requires experimentation to find what works for you.
