## My Take

Switzerland offers perhaps Europe's most developed CBD market, thanks to the 1% THC limit that allows products impossible to sell legally in EU countries. If you want full-spectrum products with more complete cannabinoid profiles, Switzerland is the place.

However, this permissiveness comes with a catch: Swiss CBD products may get you in trouble in neighboring countries where 0.2% is the limit. Don't assume what's legal in Zurich is legal in Munich.

The Swiss emphasis on quality is genuine—the country's reputation for precision extends to its CBD industry. You'll generally find well-tested, properly labeled products, though you'll pay a premium for them.

If you're visiting Switzerland and want to try CBD, it's an excellent opportunity to experience higher-quality, more complete products. Just don't bring them home if you're returning to the EU.
