## My Take

The combination of CBD and hot tub use is one of my favorite recovery protocols. The hot water relaxes muscles and increases circulation, while CBD provides anti-inflammatory and calming effects. Together, they create deeper relaxation and recovery than either alone.

It's particularly effective as an evening routine—the hot tub raises body temperature, and the subsequent cooling signals sleep time. Add CBD's sleep-supporting effects, and you have excellent sleep preparation.
