## Key Takeaways

1. **May help** some tapering difficulties
2. **Never self-adjust** opioid doses
3. **Work with doctor** on integrating CBD
4. **Addresses anxiety** and sleep
5. **Not a substitute** for medical tapering support

## My Take

Opioid tapering is difficult, and anything that can support the process is worth considering. CBD may genuinely help with anxiety, sleep, and general comfort during tapering—areas where it has evidence.

But please: never adjust your opioid dose without medical guidance. Discuss CBD as part of your tapering plan with your prescribing doctor. This isn't an area for self-management.
