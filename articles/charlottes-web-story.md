### What the Story Shows

## My Take

Charlotte's story is genuinely moving and historically important. It transformed how America thinks about CBD and helped countless families access treatment. But I also recognise that dramatic anecdotes don't equal scientific proof—which is why Epidiolex clinical trials were necessary. Charlotte's legacy is opening doors that research then walked through properly.
