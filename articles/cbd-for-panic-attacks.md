## Using CBD for Panic

## Key Takeaways

2. **Daily use may help** reduce frequency
3. **Prevention approach** most effective
4. **Works best** with proven treatments
5. **Seek professional help** for panic disorder

## My Take

If you're hoping CBD will be a rescue medication for active panic attacks, you'll likely be disappointed—it simply doesn't work fast enough. But as part of a prevention strategy, consistent CBD use may help reduce the underlying anxiety that leads to panic.

Think of CBD as one tool in managing panic, not the solution. Combine it with therapy, breathing techniques, and other evidence-based approaches for best results.
