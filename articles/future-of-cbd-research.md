## My Take

CBD research is at an exciting inflection point. The anecdotal era is giving way to rigorous science. While many questions remain, the trajectory is clear: more and better research is coming. This will benefit consumers through validated applications, optimised products, and clearer guidance. The future holds both confirmation of some claims and likely refutation of others—science's job is to sort that out.
