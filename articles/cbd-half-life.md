## Quick Summary

CBD's half-life—the time for blood levels to reduce by half—is approximately 18-32 hours with regular use. This means CBD accumulates with consistent dosing and can remain detectable for days to weeks after stopping. Understanding half-life helps with dosing and drug test timing.

## Key Takeaways

- Half-life: 18-32 hours (varies by method and use pattern)
- Single-dose half-life may be shorter (2-5 hours for inhaled)
- Accumulates in fatty tissue with regular use
- Complete elimination: approximately 5-7 days after stopping
- Drug tests detect metabolites longer than CBD itself

## Half-Life by Administration Method

### Inhaled CBD

- **Initial half-life:** 2-5 hours (rapid phase)
- **Terminal half-life:** 18-32 hours (elimination phase)
- Biphasic elimination pattern
- Fast onset, faster initial decline

### Oral/Sublingual CBD

- **Half-life:** 18-32 hours
- More consistent elimination
- Slower onset, more stable levels
- Food affects absorption but not half-life

### With Regular Use

Chronic users show:
- Longer half-life (accumulation)
- Steady-state levels after 4-5 days
- Greater tissue storage
- Longer elimination after stopping

## Factors Affecting Half-Life

### Body Composition

- Fat percentage affects storage
- Higher body fat = longer retention
- CBD is highly fat-soluble
- Lean individuals eliminate faster

### Metabolism

- Faster metabolisers clear sooner
- Age affects metabolism
- Liver health matters
- Drug interactions can slow elimination

### Dose and Duration

- Higher doses take longer to clear
- Chronic use increases retention
- Tissue accumulation with regular use

## Detection Windows

### Blood Tests

- Detectable: 1-2 days after single use
- With regular use: 5-7 days
- Full-spectrum products: THC may be detectable

### Urine Tests

- CBD metabolites: up to 2 weeks
- THC from full-spectrum: potentially longer
- Drug tests target THC, not CBD

---

## Practical Implications

### Dosing Schedule

Half-life informs timing:
- Once daily often sufficient
- Twice daily for more stable levels
- Consistent timing helps

### Before Surgery

Inform medical providers:
- CBD affects some anaesthetics
- Stop several days before if advised
- Disclose current use

## My Take

Understanding half-life changed how I dose CBD. Knowing it accumulates explains why consistent daily use works better than occasional large doses. It also explains the "loading period"—it takes about a week to reach stable levels. Patience during the first week is crucial for proper evaluation.
