## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD's anti-inflammatory** effects suit bursitis
2. **Topical to affected joint** area
3. **Rest is essential** for recovery
4. **Combine with** standard treatments
5. **Persistent cases** need medical evaluation

---

## My Take

Bursitis is fundamentally an inflammatory condition, making CBD a logical complementary approach. Topical application to the affected joint area allows targeted delivery of anti-inflammatory compounds.

But bursitis also requires identifying and avoiding what caused it. If you keep doing the aggravating activity, CBD won't be enough. Rest, ice, and addressing the root cause are essential alongside CBD use.
