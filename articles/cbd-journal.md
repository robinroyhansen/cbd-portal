## My Take

A CBD journal is the most valuable tool for anyone trying CBD. It costs nothing, takes minutes a day, and provides data you simply can't get any other way. Memory is unreliable—you won't remember last Tuesday's sleep quality. But a journal does. Even the simplest tracking beats no tracking. Start before your first dose, and you'll have the baseline you need to know if CBD truly works for you.
