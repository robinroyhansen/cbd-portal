## Quick Summary

Hemp and marijuana are both Cannabis sativa but differ primarily in THC content. Hemp contains less than 0.2-0.3% THC and is legal in most places, while marijuana contains higher THC levels and remains controlled. This legal distinction drives the CBD industry.

## Key Takeaways

- Both are Cannabis sativa species
- Legal distinction based on THC content
- Hemp: <0.2-0.3% THC (legal)
- Marijuana: Higher THC (usually controlled)
- CBD can come from either (legally from hemp)

---

## The Same Plant, Different Varieties

### Botanical Reality

**Scientific Classification:**
- Both: Cannabis sativa L.
- Same species
- Different cultivars/varieties
- Bred for different purposes

### Legal Reality

**Regulatory Distinction:**
- Based on THC content
- Arbitrary but legally significant
- Varies by jurisdiction
- Determines legality

---

## THC Content: The Defining Difference

### Hemp

**THC Limits:**
- EU: <0.2% (moving to 0.3%)
- US: <0.3%
- Switzerland: <1%
- Measured in dried flower

### Marijuana

**THC Levels:**
- Typically 5-30%+
- Bred for potency
- Primary intoxicating compound
- Varies by strain

### Why It Matters

- Determines legal status
- Affects product availability
- Influences testing requirements
- Impacts consumer access

---

## Chemical Composition

### Cannabinoid Profiles

| Compound | Hemp | Marijuana |
|----------|------|-----------|
| THC | Very low | High |
| CBD | Often high | Variable |
| Other cannabinoids | Present | Present |
| Total compounds | 100+ | 100+ |

### Terpenes

- Both contain terpenes
- Profiles vary by strain
- Contribute to effects
- Similar diversity

---

## Physical Differences

### Appearance

**Hemp:**
- Often taller (up to 4m)
- Thinner leaves
- Fewer branches
- Dense flower clusters

**Marijuana:**
- Usually shorter
- Broader leaves
- More branching
- Dense, resinous buds

### Growing Patterns

**Hemp:**
- Dense planting possible
- Outdoor cultivation common
- Less intensive care
- 60-90 day cycle

**Marijuana:**
- Spaced planting
- Often indoor/controlled
- More intensive cultivation
- Longer flowering

## Historical Breeding Goals

### Hemp Breeding

**Selected For:**
- Low THC content
- High CBD (modern varieties)
- Fibre quality (industrial)
- Seed production
- Fast growth

### Marijuana Breeding

**Selected For:**
- High THC content
- Potency and effects
- Flavour profiles
- Appearance
- Yield

---

## Legal Treatment

### Hemp

**Generally Permitted:**
- Industrial cultivation
- CBD product production
- Fibre and seed uses
- With licensing/permits

**Requirements:**
- Certified seed varieties
- THC testing compliance
- Novel Food (EU CBD)
- State/country specific rules

### Marijuana

**Mostly Controlled:**
- Illegal in many places
- Medical programs (some areas)
- Recreational legal (limited)
- Heavy regulation where legal

---

## CBD Source Comparison

### Hemp-Derived CBD

**Advantages:**
- Legal in most jurisdictions
- THC naturally very low
- Large-scale production
- Accessible products

**Considerations:**
- Still subject to regulations
- Quality varies
- Novel Food compliance (EU)

### Marijuana-Derived CBD

**Reality:**
- Same CBD molecule
- Often combined with THC
- Medical programs mostly
- Limited legal access

---

## Common Misconceptions

### Myth vs Fact

**Myth:** Hemp and marijuana are different species
**Fact:** Same species, different varieties

**Myth:** Hemp CBD is different from marijuana CBD
**Fact:** CBD molecule is identical

**Myth:** Hemp cannot get you high
**Fact:** Legal hemp has too little THC to cause intoxication

**Myth:** All cannabis is marijuana
**Fact:** Hemp is also cannabis

---

## Why the Confusion Exists

### Historical Context

**Prohibition Era:**
- All cannabis treated same
- No legal distinction
- Hemp industry collapsed
- Terminology conflated

### Modern Distinction

- Legal framework created difference
- THC threshold set arbitrarily
- Industry rebuilt on distinction
- Terminology still confusing

---

## Implications for Consumers

### When Buying CBD

**From Hemp:**
- Generally legal
- Low THC confirmed
- Widely available
- Subject to quality variance

**Important Considerations:**
- Verify THC content
- Check legal status locally
- Ensure quality testing
- Understand product type

---

## My Take

The hemp/marijuana distinction is more legal than botanical. Both are cannabis, and the THC threshold is somewhat arbitrary. However, this distinction enables the legal CBD market. Understanding it helps you navigate the regulatory landscape and make informed choices about legal, hemp-derived CBD products.
