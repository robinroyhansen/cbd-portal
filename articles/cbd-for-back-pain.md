## Key Takeaways

## My Take

Back pain is one of the most common reasons people try CBD, and it makes sense given the anti-inflammatory and pain-modulating properties. I've heard from many people who find meaningful relief using CBD as part of their back care routine.

The combination of oral CBD for systemic effects and topical CBD for targeted relief often works better than either alone. But remember—CBD supports back health; it doesn't fix underlying problems. Proper movement, posture, and professional care remain essential.
