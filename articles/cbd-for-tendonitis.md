## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD's anti-inflammatory** effects may help tendonitis
2. **Topical to affected area** is primary approach
3. **Rest is essential** for healing
4. **Combine with** standard treatments
5. **Chronic cases** need professional evaluation

---

## My Take

Tendonitis responds well to anti-inflammatory approaches, making CBD a logical option. Topical application directly to the affected tendon area makes sense given local action is the goal.

But remember: tendons heal slowly and need rest. CBD might help manage symptoms, but you can't just treat through tendonitis without addressing the cause. Rest from aggravating activities is non-negotiable.
