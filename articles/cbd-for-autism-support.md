## Key Takeaways

2. **Targets anxiety**, behavior, sleep
3. **Work with healthcare** team
4. **Quality products** essential
5. **Not a cure** but may help symptoms

## My Take

The CBD-autism research is interesting, particularly for anxiety and behavioral challenges that often accompany autism. Some families report meaningful improvements in quality of life.

But approach this carefully. Work with your healthcare team, use quality products, and have realistic expectations. CBD may help manage certain symptoms, but it's not a cure and responses vary significantly between individuals.
