## Quick Summary

Ethanol extraction uses food-grade alcohol to dissolve cannabinoids from hemp. It's efficient, scalable, and produces safe extracts when properly processed. While less selective than CO2 extraction, it's cost-effective for large-scale production and widely used in the industry.

## Key Takeaways

- Uses food-grade ethanol as extraction solvent
- Highly efficient and scalable
- Safe when ethanol is fully removed
- May extract chlorophyll (green colour)
- Requires thorough purification steps

## How Ethanol Extraction Works

### The Process

1. **Soaking** — Hemp material soaked in cold or warm ethanol
2. **Dissolution** — Cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds dissolve
3. **Filtration** — Plant material filtered out
4. **Evaporation** — Ethanol removed through distillation
5. **Refinement** — Further processing to remove unwanted compounds

### Temperature Variations

- **Cold ethanol** — Minimises chlorophyll extraction, cleaner product
- **Warm ethanol** — More efficient but extracts more unwanted compounds
- **Room temperature** — Balance of efficiency and selectivity

## Advantages

### Efficiency

- Fast extraction process
- High cannabinoid yields
- Scalable to large volumes
- Cost-effective

### Safety

- Ethanol is food-safe
- FDA-approved solvent
- Well-understood process
- When purified, leaves no harmful residue

---

## Disadvantages

### Selectivity

- Extracts chlorophyll and waxes
- Requires winterisation (removing fats)
- May need additional purification
- Less selective than CO2

### Terpene Concerns

- Some terpene loss during evaporation
- Heat during processing may degrade compounds
- Cold extraction helps preserve terpenes

---

## Quality Considerations

### Residual Solvent Testing

Essential to verify:
- Ethanol levels below safety limits
- No contamination from denatured ethanol
- Complete removal verified by testing

### Post-Processing

Common refinement steps:
- Winterisation (fat removal)
- Filtration
- Distillation
- Decarboxylation if needed

## My Take

Ethanol extraction gets unfair criticism sometimes. When done properly with cold ethanol and thorough purification, it produces safe, effective products. Many excellent CBD brands use ethanol extraction because it's practical at scale. The key is quality testing, not just the extraction method.
