## My Take

I'll be direct: if hot flashes are your main concern, CBD isn't the first thing I'd try. The evidence doesn't support a direct benefit, and other treatments are more effective.

However, if you're experiencing multiple menopause symptoms—sleep problems, anxiety, mood changes, joint pain—CBD might help with those while you address hot flashes through other means.
