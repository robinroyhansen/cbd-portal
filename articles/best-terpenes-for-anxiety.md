## Key Takeaways

- Linalool has the strongest research support for anxiety
- Limonene provides uplifting effects without sedation
- Caryophyllene offers calm through CB2 activation
- Combination approaches may be most effective
- Terpene profiles significantly influence CBD's anxiolytic potential

## Top Terpenes for Anxiety

### 1. Linalool — The Gold Standard

**Why it helps:**
- Primary terpene in lavender (centuries of anxiolytic use)
- GABA receptor modulation (similar to benzodiazepines, but gentler)
- Well-researched in human studies
- Reduces cortisol and stress markers

**Research highlights:**
- Silexan (lavender oil) shows efficacy comparable to lorazepam
- Pre-surgery anxiety reduction in human trials
- Consistent anxiolytic effects across multiple studies

**Best for:**
- General anxiety
- Social anxiety
- Acute stress situations
- Nighttime anxiety

### 2. Limonene — Uplifting Calm

**Why it helps:**
- Mood elevation without sedation
- Serotonin and dopamine influence
- Reduces anxious rumination
- Daytime-appropriate

**Research highlights:**
- Citrus aromatherapy reduces anxiety scores
- Anti-stress effects in animal models
- May work through 5-HT1A receptors (like CBD)

**Best for:**
- Daytime anxiety
- Depression-related anxiety
- Stress without wanting sedation
- Mood support

### 3. Caryophyllene — The CB2 Calmer

**Why it helps:**
- Only terpene that activates cannabinoid receptors
- CB2 activation reduces anxiety-related behaviours
- Anti-inflammatory (anxiety often has inflammatory component)
- Doesn't cause sedation

**Research highlights:**
- CB2 agonism produces anxiolytic effects
- Anti-anxiety effects in animal models
- May reduce both anxiety and depression

**Best for:**
- Anxiety with inflammatory conditions
- Chronic stress
- Anxiety without wanting to feel "sedated"

### 4. Myrcene — Relaxation Support

**Why it helps:**
- General relaxation

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which terpene is best for panic attacks?

Fast-acting options matter most. Linalool through inhalation (vaping or aromatherapy) may provide quickest relief. Limonene-rich products can help without adding sedation. For ongoing panic disorder, consistent daily use matters more than acute relief.

### Can terpenes replace anxiety medications?

Not directly. Terpenes and CBD may complement anxiety management, but shouldn't replace medications without medical guidance. Discuss integrating natural options with your healthcare provider.

### Will anxiety-reducing terpenes affect my performance?

Depends on the profile. Limonene and caryophyllene typically don't impair function. Linalool and especially myrcene may cause some sedation. Choose profiles based on when you need support.

### How long do terpene effects last for anxiety?

Effects typically last 2-4 hours for sublingual products, longer for edibles. Many find consistent daily use more effective than as-needed use for ongoing anxiety management.

## My Take

Linalool is non-negotiable for my anxiety-focused CBD products. Its research base is simply the strongest, and the connection to lavender's traditional use is meaningful. For daytime use, I add limonene to maintain energy. The combination of CBD's serotonin effects with these terpenes creates a genuinely effective anti-anxiety formula that I've seen work for many people.
