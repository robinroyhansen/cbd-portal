## Quick Summary

Myrcene is the most abundant terpene in cannabis, often comprising over 50% of a strain's terpene profile. Known for its earthy, musky aroma with hints of fruit, myrcene is associated with relaxing, sedating effects and may enhance CBD's therapeutic potential through the entourage effect.

## Key Takeaways

- Myrcene is the dominant terpene in most cannabis and hemp strains
- Associated with relaxing, potentially sedating effects
- Found naturally in mangoes, hops, lemongrass, and thyme
- May enhance cannabinoid absorption and effects
- Commonly present in CBD products marketed for sleep and relaxation

## What Is Myrcene?

Myrcene (β-myrcene) is a monoterpene—a class of organic compounds produced by plants. It's the most prevalent terpene found in cannabis, giving many strains their characteristic earthy, herbal scent with subtle fruity undertones.

Beyond cannabis, myrcene occurs naturally in:
- **Mangoes** — Contributing to their tropical aroma
- **Hops** — A key component in beer's flavour
- **Lemongrass** — Used in traditional medicine for centuries
- **Thyme and bay leaves** — Common culinary herbs
- **Verbena** — Used in herbal preparations

The terpene's name derives from *Myrcia sphaerocarpa*, a Brazilian medicinal plant traditionally used for various ailments.

## Myrcene's Effects and Benefits

### Potential Relaxing Properties

Myrcene is often associated with the "couch-lock" effect in high-THC cannabis, but even in CBD products, it may contribute to relaxation. Research suggests myrcene has:

- **Sedative qualities** — Animal studies indicate muscle-relaxing effects
- **Calming properties** — May reduce physical tension
- **Sleep support** — Often found in strains marketed for nighttime use

### Anti-Inflammatory Potential

Laboratory studies have examined myrcene's effects on inflammation:

- A 2015 study in the *European Journal of Pharmacology* found myrcene reduced inflammation in cell models
- Research suggests it may work through prostaglandin pathways
- These findings are preliminary and require human clinical trials

### Analgesic Properties

Animal research indicates myrcene may have pain-relieving effects:

- Studies show it may reduce pain perception in animal models
- The mechanism may involve opioid-like pathways
- More research is needed to confirm effects in humans

## How Myrcene Works

### The Entourage Effect

Myrcene is believed to enhance cannabinoid effects through the entourage effect—the theory that cannabis compounds work better together than in isolation.

Specifically, myrcene may:
- **Increase cell membrane permeability** — Potentially allowing cannabinoids to cross the blood-brain barrier more easily
- **Enhance absorption** — Some research suggests it may improve bioavailability
- **Modulate receptor activity** — May influence how cannabinoids interact with receptors

### Interaction with the Endocannabinoid System

While terpenes don't bind to cannabinoid receptors like CBD or THC, myrcene may:
- Influence GABA receptors (associated with relaxation)
- Affect adenosine signalling (related to sleep)
- Modulate inflammatory pathways

## Myrcene in CBD Products

### Where You'll Find It

Myrcene is common in:
- **Full-spectrum CBD oils** — Naturally present from hemp extraction
- **Broad-spectrum products** — Retained during THC removal
- **Terpene-enhanced products** — Sometimes added for specific effects
- **CBD flower** — Varies by strain

### Identifying Myrcene Content

Quality CBD products may list terpene profiles on their Certificate of Analysis (COA). Look for:
- Myrcene percentage in the terpene breakdown
- Products marketed for "relaxation" or "sleep" often have higher myrcene
- Full-spectrum products typically contain more terpenes than isolates

### Strains High in Myrcene

Hemp strains known for high myrcene content include:
- **Granddaddy Purple** — Often 50%+ myrcene
- **Blue Dream** — Balanced myrcene profile
- **OG Kush** — Significant myrcene presence
- **Remedy** — CBD-dominant with notable myrcene

## Research on Myrcene

### Current Evidence

Research on myrcene includes:

**Animal Studies:**
- A 1990 study found myrcene had sedative effects in mice
- Research shows anti-inflammatory effects in cell and animal models
- Studies indicate potential analgesic properties

**Limitations:**
- Most research is preclinical (animals or cells)
- Human clinical trials are lacking
- Dosing in studies often exceeds amounts in CBD products
- Effects of isolated myrcene may differ from myrcene in whole-plant extracts

### The Mango Myth

Popular claims suggest eating mangoes before consuming cannabis enhances effects due to myrcene. While mangoes do contain myrcene, the amounts are relatively small, and this theory lacks scientific validation.

## Myrcene vs Other Terpenes

| Terpene | Aroma | Associated Effects | Common In |
|---------|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Myrcene** | Earthy, musky, fruity | Relaxation, sedation | Most cannabis strains |
| **Limonene** | Citrus | Mood elevation, energy | Citrus fruits |
| **Linalool** | Floral, lavender | Calming, anxiety relief | Lavender |
| **Pinene** | Pine | Alertness, focus | Pine trees |
| **Caryophyllene** | Spicy, peppery | Anti-inflammatory | Black pepper |

## Safety Considerations

Myrcene is generally considered safe:
- Present in many foods and approved as a flavouring agent
- No significant adverse effects reported at typical CBD product levels
- The EU and FDA consider it safe for food use

However:
- Concentrated myrcene supplements may have different safety profiles
- Always choose quality-tested CBD products
- Consult healthcare providers if you have concerns

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does myrcene make you sleepy?

Myrcene is associated with relaxing effects and may contribute to drowsiness, particularly in higher concentrations. Products high in myrcene are often marketed for evening or nighttime use. However, individual responses vary significantly.

### How can I tell if my CBD product contains myrcene?

Check the Certificate of Analysis (COA) for terpene testing. Quality brands test for terpene profiles and list them separately. Full-spectrum and broad-spectrum products typically contain myrcene naturally from hemp extraction.

### Is myrcene the same in mangoes and cannabis?

Yes, myrcene is the same molecule regardless of source. However, concentrations vary dramatically—cannabis typically contains far more myrcene than mangoes.

### Can I add myrcene to CBD isolate?

Some companies sell terpene blends that can be added to CBD isolate. However, this requires careful dosing and quality sourcing. Pre-made full-spectrum or broad-spectrum products are simpler alternatives.

## My Take

Myrcene is a fascinating terpene that likely contributes to the relaxing effects many people experience with certain CBD products. While the science is still catching up to traditional use patterns, there's enough evidence to suggest myrcene plays a meaningful role in the entourage effect. If you're seeking CBD products for relaxation or sleep, looking at myrcene content alongside CBD potency is worthwhile.
