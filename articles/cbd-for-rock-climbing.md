## Key Takeaways

1. **Finger and forearm** recovery is key
2. **Anxiety management** for lead climbing
3. **Skin care** benefits from topicals
4. **Post-climb** timing most valuable
5. **Sleep support** for hard days

---

## My Take

Climbing's unique demands on fingers and forearms make recovery crucial for long-term progression. CBD can support that recovery process, helping manage inflammation and potentially speeding return to full strength.

The mental aspect is interesting too—many climbers find CBD helps take the edge off lead climbing nerves without dulling the focus needed for hard moves.
