## Quick Answer

Most research on CBD for anxiety uses doses between **150-600mg**, but many people find relief at lower doses (25-75mg). The optimal approach is starting low (15-25mg) and gradually increasing until you find your effective dose. Timing matters—take CBD 30-60 minutes before anticipated anxiety or use daily for baseline reduction.

## What Research Shows

### Clinical Trial Doses

| Study Type | Dose Used | Findings |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Social anxiety (public speaking) | 300mg | Reduced anxiety significantly |
| Social anxiety disorder | 400mg | Comparable to standard treatment |
| Generalized anxiety | 25-75mg | Improved sleep and anxiety |
| PTSD | 25-50mg (daily) | Reduced symptoms over time |

**Note:** Research doses are often higher than typical consumer use.

## Starting Protocol

### Week 1-2: Baseline
- **Start:** 15-25mg daily
- **Timing:** Morning or evening (experiment)
- **Track:** Anxiety levels, sleep, any effects
- **Assess:** Any response at this dose?

### Week 3-4: Adjustment
- If no effect: Increase to 30-50mg
- If mild effect: May stay or slight increase
- If good effect: Maintain dose
- **Continue tracking**

### Week 5+: Optimization
- Fine-tune dose based on response
- Find minimum effective dose
- Adjust timing if needed
- Consider situational vs. daily use

## Dosing Strategies

### Daily Baseline Dosing
**For:** Generalized anxiety, chronic stress
- Take same dose daily
- Builds steady levels
- More consistent effect
- **Typical range:** 25-75mg/day

### Situational/As-Needed
**For:** Specific anxiety triggers (public speaking, flights, etc.)
- Take 30-60 minutes before trigger
- Higher single dose often needed
- **Typical range:** 50-150mg per use

### Combined Approach
**For:** Baseline anxiety with occasional spikes
- Daily low dose (15-25mg)
- Additional dose before triggers
- Provides flexibility

## Factors Affecting Your Dose

### Body Weight
Rough starting point:
| Weight | Starting Dose |
|--------|---------------|
| <150 lbs | 15-20mg |
| 150-200 lbs | 20-30mg |
| >200 lbs | 25-35mg |

**Note:** Weight is just one factor; response varies widely.

### Anxiety Severity
- Mild anxiety: Often responds to lower doses
- Moderate anxiety: May need mid-range doses
- Severe anxiety: May need higher doses or professional help

### CBD Product Type
| Type | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Full-spectrum | May need lower dose (entourage effect) |
| Broad-spectrum | Similar to full-spectrum |
| Isolate | May need higher dose |

### Individual Variation
- Metabolism speed
- Endocannabinoid system differences
- Genetic factors
- Prior CBD/cannabis experience

## What to Expect

### Timeline
- **First dose:** May or may not feel noticeable effect
- **First week:** Building in system
- **2-4 weeks:** Better sense of effectiveness
- **4-6 weeks:** Full assessment possible

### Realistic Expectations
- CBD is not instant anxiety cure
- Effects often subtle but meaningful
- May reduce frequency/intensity of anxiety
- Not a replacement for severe anxiety treatment

## Signs You've Found Your Dose

**Positive indicators:**
- Anxiety feels more manageable
- You're calmer in usually stressful situations
- Sleep has improved
- Consistent effect day to day
- No bothersome side effects

**Signs dose may be too low:**
- No noticeable change
- Anxiety unchanged after 3-4 weeks

**Signs dose may be too high:**
- Excessive drowsiness
- Digestive issues
- Diminishing returns vs. lower dose

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Starting too high:** Can cause drowsiness, miss optimal range
2. **Not giving it time:** Expecting instant results
3. **Inconsistent use:** Skipping days, varying doses
4. **Wrong timing:** Taking too close to or far from anxiety trigger
5. **Poor quality products:** Inaccurate labeling, inconsistent doses

---

## When CBD Isn't Enough

Consider additional support if:
- Anxiety is severe or debilitating
- CBD provides no relief after proper trial
- Panic attacks are frequent
- Anxiety significantly impairs daily life
- You have thoughts of self-harm

**CBD can complement but shouldn't replace professional mental health treatment for significant anxiety disorders.**

## My Practical Advice

After years of working with anxious clients, here's what I've observed:

1. **Most people need less than they think.** Start with 20-25mg and work up.

2. **Consistency beats high doses.** Daily use often works better than occasional high doses.

3. **Full-spectrum usually works better for anxiety.** The terpenes and minor cannabinoids seem to help.

4. **Timing matters.** Experiment with morning vs. evening; people differ.

5. **Track your results.** Our memories are unreliable; write it down.
