## General Timing Principles

| **Topicals** | 15-45 min | Local | 2-4 hours |

### Why Timing Matters

## Morning CBD

**Good for:**
- Anxiety management
- Daily wellness routine
- Focus and clarity
- Starting the day calm

### How to Take Morning CBD

**Best approach:**
- With breakfast (fatty food helps)
- Consistent daily time
- Allow effects to onset before demands
- Lower doses typically (avoid sedation)

### Morning Dosing

**Suggestions:**
- Start with 10-15mg
- Avoid high doses if new to CBD
- Monitor for any drowsiness
- Adjust based on response

---

## Afternoon CBD

### Who Benefits

**Useful for:**
- Midday anxiety
- Work stress
- Social anxiety before events
- Afternoon energy dip

### Timing Strategies

**For work:**
- With lunch for sustained effects
- 1-2 hours before stressful meetings
- Consistent midday routine

**For events:**
- 1-2 hours before social situations
- Account for onset time
- Know your response beforehand

---

## Evening CBD

### Who Benefits

**Ideal for:**
- Sleep support
- End-of-day relaxation
- Wind-down routines
- Nighttime discomfort

### Timing for Sleep

**Best practices:**
- 1-2 hours before bed
- With evening snack (fat content helps)
- Part of consistent bedtime routine
- Earlier timing if drowsiness delayed

### Evening Dosing

**For sleep:**
- Often higher doses than daytime
- 25-50mg+ common for sleep
- Adjust based on sleep quality
- Too close to bed may mean effects haven't onset

## With or Without Food?

### With Food Benefits

**Why eat with CBD:**
- Fat increases absorption significantly
- Up to 4x better bioavailability
- More consistent effects
- Gentler on stomach

### Best Foods

**High-fat options:**
- Eggs, avocado, cheese
- Nuts and nut butters
- Fish (salmon, etc.)
- Olive oil-dressed foods

### Without Food

**Considerations:**
- Faster onset (nothing to digest)
- Lower absorption overall
- May be less predictable
- Sublingual minimizes this issue

## Timing by Goal

### For Anxiety

**Strategy:**
- Morning dose for baseline
- Additional before anxiety triggers
- Consistent daily timing
- Allow onset time before stressors

**Example schedule:**

- As-needed before anxious situations

### For Sleep

## Key Takeaways

1. **Time CBD to match your goals** — sleep vs. anxiety vs. pain
2. **Take with fatty food** for better absorption
3. **Account for onset time** — effects aren't instant
4. **Consistency improves results** — same time daily
5. **Evening for sleep** — 1-2 hours before bed
6. **Split doses** for sustained effects throughout day

## My Take

Timing is one of the most underappreciated aspects of CBD use. Many people take CBD randomly and wonder why results are inconsistent. Strategic timing aligned with your goals makes a significant difference.

For most purposes, taking CBD with food at consistent times is the foundation. From there, adjust based on what you're using it for—earlier in the day for anxiety, evening for sleep, before activities for pain management.

The single best advice: be consistent for at least two weeks before deciding if your timing strategy works. CBD builds up in your system, and effects become more predictable with regular use.
