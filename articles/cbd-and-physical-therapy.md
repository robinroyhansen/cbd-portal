## My Take

Physical therapy works, but it requires patients to show up and do uncomfortable things. CBD can make that process more tolerable, improving compliance and potentially outcomes.

The biggest benefit may be reduced post-session soreness, which helps patients stay consistent with their PT programs. If you're doing physical therapy, CBD is a reasonable addition to support the process.
