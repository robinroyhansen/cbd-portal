## Quick Answer

There's no universal CBD dose—effective amounts vary from 10mg to 100mg+ depending on the person and purpose. **Start low (10-20mg), observe effects, and gradually increase.** Most people find their effective dose between 20-50mg for general wellness.

## Why Dosing Varies So Much

### Individual Factors

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Body weight** | Larger bodies often need more |
| **Metabolism** | Fast metabolizers may need higher doses |
| **ECS tone** | Your baseline endocannabinoid activity |
| **Sensitivity** | Some respond to very low doses |
| **Purpose** | Sleep needs more than mild stress |
| **Tolerance** | Regular use may require adjustment |

### No Standard Dose

Unlike pharmaceuticals, CBD:
- Hasn't established standard dosing
- Shows wide effective range in studies
- Works differently for different people
- Has a good safety profile across doses

## General Dosing Guidelines

### By Purpose

| Purpose | Typical Range | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| **Mild stress/wellness** | 10-25mg | Lower end often works |
| **Anxiety** | 25-75mg | Dose varies widely by individual |
| **Sleep** | 25-75mg | Higher doses more sedating |
| **Pain/inflammation** | 30-100mg+ | Often needs more |
| **Severe anxiety** | 50-150mg+ | Some studies use higher |

### By Body Weight

A rough starting point (not a rule):
- Under 150 lbs: 10-15mg start
- 150-200 lbs: 15-25mg start
- Over 200 lbs: 20-30mg start

Adjust based on response, not weight alone.

## The Start Low Approach

### Week 1-2

1. **Start with 10-20mg** daily
2. Take at consistent time
3. Note any effects (or lack of)
4. Give it 3-5 days before judging

### Week 2-3

If insufficient effect:
1. **Increase by 5-10mg**
2. Maintain new dose for several days
3. Continue noting effects
4. Increase again if needed

### Finding Your Dose

- Keep increasing until you notice benefit
- Or until you reach diminishing returns
- Some people need 50mg+, others need 15mg
- Your dose is individual

## Dosing by Product Type

### CBD Oil/Tinctures

Most flexible dosing:
- Measure by drops or dropper markings
- Know your product's concentration
- Example: 30ml bottle with 1000mg = ~33mg/ml
- Adjust easily in small increments

### CBD Capsules

Consistent but less flexible:
- Pre-measured doses (10mg, 25mg, etc.)
- Easy for consistent daily use
- Harder to fine-tune dose
- Choose strength that matches your needs

### CBD Edibles/Gummies

Similar to capsules:
- Fixed doses per piece
- Easy to use
- Check label for CBD per gummy
- Be aware of sugar/calorie content

### CBD Topicals

Different approach:
- Applied directly to skin
- Dose measured by application area
- Start with small amount
- Reapply as needed
- Doesn't affect systemic dosing

## Common Dosing Mistakes

### Starting Too High

Problem:
- May cause unnecessary drowsiness
- Wastes product
- Doesn't give you baseline

Fix: Start with 10-20mg regardless of what you've heard.

### Not Waiting Long Enough

Problem:
- CBD benefits may take days/weeks to notice
- Changing dose daily prevents evaluation

Fix: Give each dose level at least 3-5 days.

### Expecting Immediate Effects

Problem:
- CBD isn't like taking a painkiller
- Effects are often subtle
- Looking for wrong experience

Fix: Note general wellbeing over time, not immediate "high."

### Using Inconsistently

Problem:
- Taking CBD sporadically limits benefits
- Hard to evaluate effectiveness

Fix: Use consistently for 2-4 weeks to evaluate.

## Timing Considerations

### For General Wellness

- Morning or evening—your preference
- Consistency matters more than timing
- Split doses (morning/evening) work for some

### For Sleep

- 1-2 hours before bed
- May need higher doses
- Allow time for onset

### For Anxiety

- Can take as needed
- Or consistent daily dose for baseline support
- Before anticipated stressors (give time to work)

### For Pain

- Consistent daily dosing often best
- Can add extra dose for flare-ups
- Morning and evening dosing common

---

## Calculating Your Dose

### From Tinctures

**Formula:**
Total CBD ÷ Bottle size (ml) = mg per ml

**Example:**
- 1500mg CBD in 30ml bottle
- 1500 ÷ 30 = 50mg per ml
- 1ml = approximately one full dropper
- Half dropper = ~25mg

### From Capsules/Gummies

Simply check the label—CBD per unit is listed.

---

## High Doses

### When More Might Help

- Severe symptoms
- Large body size
- Fast metabolism
- No response to moderate doses

### Safety at Higher Doses

Studies have used doses up to 1500mg/day:
- Generally well-tolerated
- Side effects increase with dose
- More drowsiness likely
- Higher cost
- Check with healthcare provider

### Diminishing Returns

At some point, more doesn't mean better:
- Benefits may plateau
- Side effects may increase
- Cost becomes significant
- Find your minimum effective dose

---

## Micro-Dosing CBD

### What It Is

Very low doses (5-10mg or less):
- Subtle effects
- May support ECS without strong effects
- Some prefer this approach
- Especially for CBD-sensitive individuals

### Who Might Benefit

- Those sensitive to supplements
- People wanting minimal effects
- Cost-conscious users
- Those who respond to low doses

---

## Tracking Your Response

### What to Note

Keep a simple log:
- Date and dose
- Time taken
- What you notice (or don't)
- Sleep quality, mood, pain level
- Any side effects

### Evaluating

After 2-4 weeks:
- What dose worked best?
- What timing works?
- Any adjustments needed?
- Is CBD helping your goals?

## Key Takeaways

1. **No universal dose** — individual response varies widely
2. **Start low (10-20mg)** and increase gradually
3. **Give it time** — evaluate over days/weeks, not hours
4. **Consistency matters** for evaluating effectiveness
5. **Higher isn't always better** — find minimum effective dose
6. **Track your response** to optimize

---

## My Take

The most common mistake I see is people starting with doses that are either too low to notice or too high and wasteful. The 10-20mg starting point lets you establish a baseline without side effects, then you can increase purposefully.

Don't expect CBD to feel like a drug kicking in. For most uses, you're looking for subtle improvements over time—better sleep quality, less background anxiety, more manageable discomfort. If you're expecting a dramatic immediate experience, you'll be disappointed (and might keep increasing dose unnecessarily).

Find the lowest dose that achieves your goals and stick with it. This is both cost-effective and reduces any chance of side effects. Some people genuinely need 100mg+, but many do fine with 25-50mg.
