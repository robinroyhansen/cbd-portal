## Key Takeaways

2. **Cost is higher** but versatility greater
3. **Research varies** across supplements
4. **Combining possible** with caution
5. **Choose based on** specific needs

## My Take

CBD isn't necessarily "better" than traditional herbal supplements—it's different. Its advantage is versatility: one supplement that addresses anxiety, sleep, pain, and inflammation. Traditional herbs often excel at specific things but don't have CBD's breadth.

For many people, CBD's ability to address multiple issues simultaneously makes it worth the higher cost. But if you have a specific, singular issue and budget matters, traditional herbs may serve you well.
