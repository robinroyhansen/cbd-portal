## My Take

Golf's unique combination of mental pressure and physical repetition makes it well-suited for CBD use. The calming effects can help with first-tee nerves and pressure situations, while anti-inflammatory properties support recovery from the swing's repetitive stress.

Use low doses during play—you want to be calm and focused, not sedated. Save higher doses for post-round recovery.
