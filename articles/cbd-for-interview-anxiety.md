- Review your notes
- Arrive early

### During Interview

With reduced anxiety:
- Better able to listen
- Clearer responses
- More natural rapport
- Show authentic self

### Types of Interviews

For different formats:
- Phone: Same timing works

## Key Takeaways

1. **Interview anxiety is common** and manageable
2. **CBD may reduce** nervousness and physical symptoms
3. **Time it right** (45-60 minutes before)
4. **Test thoroughly** before actual interviews
5. **Prepare well** — CBD helps anxiety, not knowledge

---

## My Take

Interview anxiety can make you present as less capable than you are. CBD might help bridge that gap—letting your actual qualifications show through without the anxiety filter.

But remember: CBD takes the edge off anxiety, it doesn't create skills or knowledge. The best interview strategy combines solid preparation with anxiety management. CBD can help with the second part.
