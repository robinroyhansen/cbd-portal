## Quick Summary

First-pass metabolism is the process where the liver significantly reduces the amount of orally consumed CBD before it reaches circulation. This explains why only 6-19% of swallowed CBD enters your bloodstream, and why sublingual or inhaled methods deliver more CBD.

## Key Takeaways

- First-pass metabolism occurs when CBD passes through the liver before circulation
- Reduces oral CBD bioavailability to 6-19%
- Sublingual administration partially bypasses this
- Inhalation completely bypasses first-pass metabolism
- Food can affect the extent of first-pass metabolism

## How First-Pass Metabolism Works

### The Journey of Oral CBD

1. **Swallowing** — CBD enters stomach
2. **Absorption** — Passes through intestinal wall
3. **Portal circulation** — Blood travels to liver FIRST
4. **Liver processing** — Enzymes metabolise CBD
5. **Systemic circulation** — Remaining CBD enters bloodstream

### Why This Matters

- 60-80% of CBD broken down before reaching blood
- Only small fraction produces effects
- Higher doses needed for oral administration
- More economical methods exist

## Bypassing First-Pass Metabolism

### Sublingual Administration

Partially bypasses:
- Absorbed through oral mucosa
- Direct entry to bloodstream
- Some still swallowed (first-pass applies)
- Net bioavailability: 20-35%

### Inhalation

Completely bypasses:
- Lung absorption direct to blood
- No liver processing before circulation
- Highest bioavailability: 30-40%
- Fastest onset

### Topical

Different pathway:
- Local absorption only
- Minimal systemic circulation
- First-pass irrelevant
- Used for localised effects

## Practical Implications

### Dose Adjustments

Understanding first-pass helps:
- Oral doses need to be higher
- Don't compare oral to sublingual doses directly
- 50mg oral ≠ 50mg sublingual in effect
- Factor bioavailability into cost calculations

### Timing Considerations

First-pass metabolism explains:
- Why oral onset is slower
- Why duration is often longer
- Why effects feel different by method

## My Take

First-pass metabolism is why many people think CBD doesn't work—they're only absorbing a fraction of their dose. Once I understood this, I switched to sublingual administration and held the oil longer before swallowing. The difference was noticeable. Knowledge of basic pharmacology transforms CBD from frustrating to effective.
