## Step 3: Select Spectrum Type

### Choose Full-Spectrum If

- Want maximum entourage effect
- Don't mind trace THC
- Want comprehensive benefits

### Choose Broad-Spectrum If

### Choose Isolate If

You:

## Step 4: Determine Strength

### For Beginners

Start with:
- Lower concentration products
- 250-500mg total products
- 10-15mg per serving
- Room to increase

### For Experienced Users

Consider:
- Higher concentration products
- 1000-3000mg total products
- 25-50mg+ per serving
- Better value per mg

### Calculating Dose

Remember:
- Total mg ÷ servings = per-serving dose
- Compare per-serving, not total
- Higher concentration often better value

---

## Step 5: Verify Quality

### Non-Negotiables

Must have:
- Third-party COA
- CBD content verified
- Contaminant testing
- Reputable company

### Where to Find COA

Check:

- If unavailable, don't buy

## Key Takeaways

## My Take

The "right" CBD product is the one that matches your specific needs, fits your lifestyle, and meets quality standards. There's no universal best product—only what's best for you.

Take time to think about why you want CBD, what format you'll actually use consistently, and whether you have considerations like drug testing. Then find quality products that fit those criteria. A product that someone else loves might not be right for you—and that's okay.
