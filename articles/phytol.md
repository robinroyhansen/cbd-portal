## Quick Summary

Phytol is a diterpene alcohol produced when chlorophyll breaks down, giving green tea and cannabis their characteristic "grassy" notes. Research shows potential sedative effects, antioxidant properties, and interest in metabolic health applications.

## Key Takeaways

- Produced from chlorophyll breakdown
- Balsamic, floral, grassy aroma
- Potential sedative and relaxing effects
- Strong antioxidant properties
- Found in green tea, cannabis, and all green plants

## What Is Phytol?

Phytol is unique among cannabis terpenes—rather than being produced directly by the plant's terpene synthases, it results from chlorophyll degradation. This makes it present in virtually all green plants.

Natural sources:
- **Green tea** — Released during processing
- **All green plants** — From chlorophyll breakdown
- **Cannabis** — Particularly after drying/curing

- Relaxing effects in animal studies
- May promote calmness
- Potential sleep support

### Antioxidant Activity

Studies demonstrate:
- Significant antioxidant effects
- Cell protection properties
- Potential anti-aging benefits

### Metabolic Research

Emerging interest in:
- Potential effects on lipid metabolism
- Research on obesity-related applications
- Very early-stage investigations

## Phytol in CBD Products

Found in:
- All full-spectrum products (from plant material)
- Products made from green hemp material
- Contributes to overall "plant" character
- Universal presence in cannabis products

---

## My Take

Phytol is interesting because it's essentially unavoidable in cannabis products—if the plant was green, phytol is present. Its sedative research suggests it may contribute to the relaxing effects of full-spectrum products beyond just the well-known terpenes. Think of phytol as the quiet baseline that helps make cannabis products feel "whole plant" rather than isolated chemicals.
