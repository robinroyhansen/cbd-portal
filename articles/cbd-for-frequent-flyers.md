## My Take

Frequent flying takes a real toll on the body. CBD can help manage several aspects—jet lag, anxiety, physical discomfort—but it's not magic. You still need good sleep hygiene, hydration, and realistic expectations about adjustment time.

The biggest value for frequent flyers is probably sleep support at destinations. Falling asleep at local time, even when your body says it's wrong, is key to managing jet lag, and CBD helps with that transition.
