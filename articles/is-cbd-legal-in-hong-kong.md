## My Take

Hong Kong's CBD ban surprised many, as the city had a growing CBD market before 2023. If you visited Hong Kong before and saw CBD shops, know that situation has completely changed. The current law is clear: CBD is a dangerous drug with serious penalties.

This is a case where outdated information could cause real problems. If you're traveling to Hong Kong, ensure you have no CBD products with you.
