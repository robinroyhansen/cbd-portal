## Quick Summary

Yes, you can apply CBD oil directly to skin. CBD has shown benefits for skin health in research, including anti-inflammatory and sebum-regulating properties. However, CBD topicals are specifically formulated for skin use and may work better than repurposing oral CBD oil.

## Carrier Oil Considerations

### Common Carriers in CBD Oil

## Absorption Through Skin

### What Happens

**Transdermal CBD:**
- Absorbs into local tissue
- Reaches receptors in skin
- Minimal systemic absorption
- Localised effects

### Not the Same as Oral

- Won't get into bloodstream well
- Local effects only
- No "whole body" benefit
- Targeted application

---

## DIY vs Commercial

### Making Your Own

**Can Do:**
- Mix CBD oil with lotion
- Create simple balm
- Customise ingredients

**Limitations:**
- Not professionally formulated
- Preservation questions
- Variable results

### Commercial Products

- Professionally made
- Consistent quality
- Proper preservation
- Tested formulations

---

## Safety Considerations

### Generally Safe

**Topical CBD Is:**
- Well-tolerated
- Low risk
- Localised
- Easy to try

### Potential Issues

- Allergic reaction (rare)
- Sensitivity to carrier
- Added ingredient reactions
- Patch test first if concerned

## My Take

While you can use oral CBD oil on your skin, purpose-made topicals generally work better—they're formulated for skin absorption and feel. If you want to try CBD topically, investing in a quality topical product will likely give better results than repurposing your sublingual oil.
