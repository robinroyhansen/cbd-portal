## Quick Answer

CBD is **federally legal** in the United States when derived from hemp containing ≤0.3% THC, thanks to the 2018 Farm Bill. However, **state laws vary significantly**, and FDA regulations create complexity around CBD in foods and supplements. It's a "legal but complicated" situation.

## Federal Legal Status

### The 2018 Farm Bill

The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018:
- Removed hemp from the Controlled Substances Act
- Defined hemp as cannabis with ≤0.3% THC
- Made hemp cultivation federally legal
- Made hemp-derived products (including CBD) federally legal

### What This Means

At the federal level:
- CBD from hemp (≤0.3% THC) is legal
- You can buy, sell, possess, and transport CBD
- CBD from marijuana (>0.3% THC) remains federally illegal
- Interstate commerce of hemp CBD is permitted

---

## The FDA Complication

### CBD and the FDA

The FDA has not approved CBD as a food additive or dietary supplement:
- CBD is technically an unapproved drug ingredient (to FDA)
- Adding CBD to food = unapproved food additive
- Marketing CBD supplements with health claims = drug claims
- FDA has sent warning letters to companies making claims

### Practical Reality

Despite FDA position:
- CBD products are widely sold
- Enforcement has been limited
- Industry operates in regulatory grey area
- FDA is "working on" CBD regulations (for years)

### What This Means for Consumers

- CBD products are available everywhere
- Quality varies without strong FDA oversight
- Companies can't make explicit health claims
- Buyer should research product quality

## Key Takeaways

1. **Federally legal** if hemp-derived (≤0.3% THC)
2. **State laws vary** — check your state
3. **FDA hasn't fully regulated** — grey area
4. **Widely available** despite regulatory complexity
5. **Quality varies** — choose tested products
6. **Drug tests** can still be triggered

---

## My Take

CBD is effectively legal throughout most of the United States, despite the regulatory complexity. You can buy it online, in stores, and in many places you wouldn't expect. The FDA situation creates technical illegality that isn't enforced against consumers.

For consumers, the practical reality is that CBD is accessible. Your job is to choose quality products since FDA oversight is limited. Look for third-party testing, verify THC content if you're tested, and buy from reputable sources.

The legal landscape will likely clarify over time, but for now, hemp-derived CBD with ≤0.3% THC is your federally legal choice.
