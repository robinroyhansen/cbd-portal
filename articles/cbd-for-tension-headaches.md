## Key Takeaways

1. **Stress and tension** are key targets
2. **Oral + topical** combination effective
3. **Prevention focus** rather than acute cure
4. **Lifestyle factors** must be addressed
5. **Part of approach**, not complete solution

---

## My Take

Tension headaches are closely tied to stress and muscle tension, which makes CBD a logical tool. The combination of daily oral CBD for stress management and topical application to tight muscles addresses the condition at multiple levels.

But don't expect CBD to override poor posture, chronic stress, or inadequate sleep. It works best when you're also addressing the underlying causes. Think of CBD as making your other headache prevention efforts more effective, not replacing them.
