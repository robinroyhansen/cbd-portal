## Quick Summary

CBD pharmacology encompasses how CBD interacts with biological systems—its receptor targets, dose-response relationships, and pharmacokinetic properties. Understanding pharmacology helps explain why CBD works, how to dose it, and potential drug interactions.

---

## Key Takeaways

- CBD has over 65 known molecular targets
- Acts as modulator rather than direct activator at most targets
- Dose-response is complex (biphasic for some effects)
- Pharmacokinetics affect real-world effectiveness
- Drug interactions are pharmacologically predictable

## Pharmacodynamics: What CBD Does

### Receptor Interactions

CBD's main targets:
- **5-HT1A** — Direct agonist (anxiety)
- **GABA-A** — Positive allosteric modulator
- **CB1** — Negative allosteric modulator
- **CB2** — Weak inverse agonist
- **TRPV1** — Agonist then desensitiser
- **GPR55** — Antagonist

### Enzyme Interactions

CBD affects:
- FAAH (increases anandamide)
- CYP450 enzymes (drug interactions)
- Adenosine transporter

## Dose-Response Relationships

### Biphasic Effects

Some effects are dose-dependent:
- Lower doses may be alerting
- Higher doses more sedating
- Optimal dose varies by goal
- More isn't always better

### Clinical Dosing

Research doses vary widely:
- Anxiety: 150-600mg (studies)
- Epilepsy: 10-25 mg/kg
- Consumer products: 10-50mg typical

## Drug Interactions

### CYP450 Inhibition

CBD inhibits enzymes processing many drugs:
- Warfarin, clobazam, valproate
- Some antidepressants
- Certain heart medications

### Practical Implications

- Consult healthcare providers
- Start low when on medications
- Monitor for changes in drug effects

## My Take

CBD pharmacology validates it as a real bioactive compound, not just placebo. The complexity of its interactions explains both its broad potential and the individual variation people experience. This isn't snake oil—it's complicated medicine.
