## Quick Summary

CBD effects are typically subtle rather than dramatic. Most people notice a gentle sense of calm, easier relaxation, or reduced tension over time rather than immediate, obvious changes. Effects vary by person, product, and dosage. Patience is essential—CBD often works best with consistent use over days to weeks.

## The Subtle Nature of CBD

### Why Effects Aren't Obvious

**CBD Works By:**
- Supporting endocannabinoid system
- Modulating rather than activating
- Promoting balance
- Working with your body

**This Means:**
- Effects are regulatory
- Changes can be gradual
- May notice absence of issues
- Subtlety is normal

### Common Realisation

Many people notice CBD working by realising they're sleeping better, feeling less anxious, or managing discomfort more easily—not from a sudden sensation.

## My Take

After helping thousands of people try CBD, the most common issue I see is unrealistic expectations. People expect dramatic, immediate effects—and that's rarely how CBD works. It's subtle, gradual, and cumulative. Give it at least 2-4 weeks of consistent use before deciding if it works for you. Pay attention to patterns, not single doses. And remember: feeling "nothing" might actually be feeling balanced.
