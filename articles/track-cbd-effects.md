## Quick Summary

Tracking CBD effects helps you objectively assess whether it's working, find your optimal dose, and avoid wasting money on products that don't help you. Effective tracking involves daily ratings, noting your dose and timing, and reviewing patterns over weeks rather than judging single days.

## Key Takeaways

- Tracking reveals patterns you'd miss
- Use simple, consistent methods
- Daily logging is key
- Review weekly, not daily
- Objective data beats feelings

---

## Why Track CBD Effects?

### Without Tracking

- Rely on vague impressions
- Can't identify patterns
- Unsure if it's working
- Don't know optimal dose
- May give up too soon

### With Tracking

- Objective data to review
- Clear patterns emerge
- Know when to adjust
- Find optimal approach
- Make informed decisions

**Evening (2 minutes):**
1. Note CBD taken (dose, time)
2. Rate today's stress (1-10)
3. Rate today's discomfort (1-10)
4. Brief note if anything notable

**Morning (1 minute):**
1. Rate last night's sleep (1-10)
2. Rate morning energy (1-10)

## Weekly Review

### What to Do

**Every Week:**
1. Calculate averages for each metric
2. Compare to previous weeks
3. Note any patterns
4. Identify what's working
5. Plan adjustments if needed

### Questions to Ask

- Are metrics improving?
- Any patterns on certain days?
- Does timing affect results?
- Is current dose working?
- Any concerning changes?

---

## Recognising Patterns

### Positive Patterns

**Look For:**
- Improving weekly averages
- More consistent ratings
- Better specific days
- Fewer extreme readings

### Concerning Patterns

**Watch For:**
- No improvement after 4 weeks
- Worsening metrics
- Inconsistent effects
- Side effects appearing

### Common Discoveries

- CBD works better at certain times
- Full stomach vs. empty matters
- Specific doses more effective
- Sleep improvement precedes other benefits

---

## How Long to Track

### Minimum Periods

**Initial Trial:**
- 4 weeks minimum
- Daily tracking essential
- Weekly averages for comparison

**Ongoing:**
- Monthly check-ins
- Less frequent once stable
- Resume detailed tracking if changing

### Adequate Assessment

CBD effects are often cumulative. Don't judge effectiveness until you have at least 4 weeks of consistent use and tracking.

## Adjusting Based on Data

### When to Increase Dose

**Data Shows:**
- Minimal improvement
- No side effects
- Consistent tracking confirms
- Below typical dosing range

### When to Decrease Dose

**Data Shows:**
- Side effects present
- Already seeing results
- Lower may maintain effect
- Currently at high dose

### When to Change Products

**Data Shows:**
- No effect after adequate trial
- Consistent side effects
- Product quality concerns
- Different spectrum may help

---

## Sharing Your Data

### With Healthcare Providers

**Useful Because:**
- Objective record
- Shows your approach
- Identifies patterns
- Supports discussion

**What to Share:**
- Summary of tracking
- Average ratings over time
- Dose information

## My Take

Tracking is the difference between "I think CBD helps" and "I know CBD helps." Our memories are unreliable—we remember recent days, forget patterns, and can't calculate averages in our heads. Simple daily tracking gives you real data to work with. It only takes a few minutes, and it transforms CBD from guesswork into an informed experiment. Start tracking before you start CBD, and you'll have the baseline you need to know if it's actually working.
