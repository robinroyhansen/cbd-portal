## Quick Summary

Chromatography is a purification technique used to separate specific cannabinoids, particularly to remove THC from CBD extracts to create broad-spectrum or isolate products. It works by exploiting different molecular properties to isolate pure compounds from complex mixtures.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Separates individual cannabinoids
- Used to remove THC
- Creates broad-spectrum/isolate
- Multiple methods available
- High precision possible

---

## How It Works

### Basic Principle

Chromatography separates compounds based on:
- Different molecular sizes
- Different polarities
- Different affinities to materials
- Movement through a medium

### The Process

1. Extract dissolved in solvent (mobile phase)
2. Passed through separation medium (stationary phase)
3. Compounds move at different rates
4. Separate fractions collected
5. Pure compounds isolated

## Types Used for CBD

### Flash Chromatography

**Characteristics:**
- Pressurised column
- Faster than gravity
- Good for bulk purification
- Industry standard

**Applications:**
- THC removal
- Creating broad-spectrum
- Initial purification
- Scalable processing

### Preparative HPLC

**Characteristics:**
- High-performance liquid chromatography
- Very precise separation
- Higher cost
- Highest purity

**Applications:**
- CBD isolate production
- Minor cannabinoid isolation
- Pharmaceutical grade
- Research applications

## THC Removal

### Creating Broad-Spectrum

**Process:**
1. Start with full-spectrum extract
2. Apply chromatography
3. THC fraction separated
4. THC-free fractions combined
5. Broad-spectrum achieved

### Verification

- COA shows "ND" for THC
- Other cannabinoids retained
- Terpenes may be affected
- Quality dependent on process

---

## Creating CBD Isolate

### Further Purification

After chromatography:
- Crystallisation may follow
- 99%+ purity achieved
- All other compounds removed
- Pure CBD crystals

### Trade-offs

- No entourage effect
- Very pure and consistent
- Suitable for sensitive users
- THC-free guaranteed

---

## Quality Considerations

### Well-Processed Products

- Clean separation achieved
- Target compounds preserved
- Unwanted compounds removed
- Verified by testing

### Potential Issues

- Incomplete THC removal
- Loss of desired compounds
- Degradation from processing
- Quality variation

---

## Cost Implications

### Why Broad-Spectrum Costs More

- Additional processing step
- Specialised equipment
- Technical expertise
- Lower yields

### Value Proposition

- THC-free confidence
- Maintains other cannabinoids
- Worth premium for some users
- Testing required regardless

---

## Analytical vs Preparative

### Analytical Chromatography

- Used for testing (lab)
- Small quantities
- Identifies compounds
- Quality control

### Preparative Chromatography

- Used for production
- Large quantities
- Separates compounds
- Manufacturing scale

---

## My Take

Chromatography is the key technology that makes broad-spectrum and THC-free products possible. It's sophisticated chemistry that enables product diversity in the CBD market. For consumers who need THC-free products, this technology provides the solution—just verify with testing that it worked.
