## Key Takeaways

1. **Dating anxiety is common** and understandable
2. **CBD may help** calm pre-date nerves
3. **Low doses** keep you engaged
4. **Test first** before important dates
5. **Enables authenticity** by reducing anxiety barrier

## My Take

Dating anxiety is frustrating because it can prevent you from showing who you actually are. CBD might help dial down that nervous energy so you can be more present and authentic on dates.

Keep the dose low—you want to be calm but definitely engaged and interested. The goal is reducing the anxiety that gets in the way, not changing your personality.
