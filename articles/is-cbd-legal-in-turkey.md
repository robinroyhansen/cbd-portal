## My Take

Turkey is a beautiful country that attracts millions of tourists, but its CBD laws are unambiguous: all cannabinoids are prohibited. There's no legal CBD market, no exemptions, and no tolerance.

If you're visiting Turkey and use CBD, plan your trip knowing you'll need to go without. Remove CBD from all your belongings before traveling—not just your carry-on, but checked luggage too.

Don't assume Turkey is like nearby EU countries where CBD is legal. Turkey has its own legal framework, and it's firmly on the prohibition side for CBD.
