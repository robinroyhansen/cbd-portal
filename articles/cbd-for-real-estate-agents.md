## Key Takeaways

## My Take

Real estate is a high-stress career with unique pressures—commission-based income, demanding clients, and schedules that don't respect personal time. CBD can help manage the anxiety that comes with these pressures while supporting better sleep despite irregular hours.

The key is maintaining professional sharpness while reducing unnecessary anxiety. CBD helps with the background stress that can make client interactions more difficult and decision-making less clear. It's about performing better because you're less anxious, not being impaired.
