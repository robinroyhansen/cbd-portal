## Quick Summary

Clinical research on CBD has grown substantially, with human trials examining epilepsy, anxiety, pain, sleep, and other conditions. While results are generally promising, most studies are small and short-term. The exception is epilepsy, where rigorous trials led to FDA approval.

## Key Takeaways

- Clinical trials have increased dramatically since 2015
- Epilepsy has the most robust clinical evidence
- Anxiety trials show consistent positive results
- Pain trials are limited but promising
- Most studies use higher doses than typical consumer products

---

## Major Clinical Findings

### Epilepsy

The strongest evidence:
- Large, multicentre RCTs
- Significant seizure reduction
- FDA/EMA approval achieved
- Doses: 10-25 mg/kg/day
- Consistent replication

### Anxiety

Consistent positive findings:
- Social anxiety studies show benefit
- Public speaking anxiety reduced
- PTSD symptoms improved in trials
- Doses: 150-600mg in studies
- Need for larger trials

### Pain

Limited but promising:
- Mostly combination products studied
- Some CBD-specific trials ongoing
- Preclinical data strong
- Human evidence building

### Sleep

Emerging evidence:
- Some positive trial results
- Often studied as secondary outcome
- Higher doses may be sedating
- More research needed

## Understanding Trial Results

### What to Look For

- **Randomised controlled trial (RCT)** — Gold standard
- **Sample size** — Larger is better
- **Duration** — Longer provides more data
- **Dose** — Compare to product you're using
- **Placebo comparison** — Essential for validity

### Common Limitations

- Small sample sizes
- Short durations
- Industry funding in some
- Varied products used

---

## Doses in Studies vs Products

Important context:
- **Studies often use:** 150-1500mg/day
- **Consumer products typically:** 10-50mg/day
- Extrapolation is uncertain
- Higher doses have more side effects

---

## My Take

Clinical research gives CBD more credibility than most supplements. The epilepsy trials are as rigorous as any pharmaceutical. Anxiety research is promising and consistent. But I maintain perspective—many studies use doses far higher than typical products. The direction of evidence is positive; the magnitude of effect at consumer doses is still being understood.
