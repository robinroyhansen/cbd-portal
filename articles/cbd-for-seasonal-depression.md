## Key Takeaways

1. **SAD has effective** treatments (light therapy)
2. **CBD may complement** but not replace
3. **Addresses anxiety** and sleep components
4. **Use light therapy** as foundation
5. **Seek professional help** for significant SAD

---

## My Take

SAD is one condition where we have effective treatments—light therapy works well for many people. I'd recommend starting there rather than expecting CBD to address seasonal depression directly.

That said, CBD might provide supportive benefits: helping with the anxiety that often accompanies SAD, supporting better sleep, and contributing to overall wellbeing during difficult months. Use it alongside, not instead of, proven SAD treatments.
