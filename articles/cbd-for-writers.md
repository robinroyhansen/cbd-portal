## Key Takeaways

1. **Creative blocks** may respond to anxiety reduction
2. **Lower doses** to stay sharp for writing
3. **Topical for** desk-related physical strain
4. **Part of ritual**, not replacement for practice
5. **Individual experimentation** needed

## My Take

Writing is hard, and anything that makes it slightly less painful has value. CBD may help by reducing the anxiety that blocks creativity and makes the blank page terrifying. The calm focus it can provide suits the sustained attention writing requires.

But CBD doesn't make you a better writer—only writing does that. Use it as a tool to make getting to the work easier, not as a substitute for doing the work. The words still have to come from you.
