## Quick Answer

THCP (Tetrahydrocannabiphorol) is a naturally occurring cannabinoid discovered in 2019 that may be up to 33 times more potent at CB1 receptors than delta-9-THC. This extreme potency means even small amounts could produce strong psychoactive effects. THCP is found in trace amounts in cannabis and has very limited research.

## What is THCP?

THCP was discovered by Italian researchers who identified it in a strain of cannabis. What makes THCP unique is its longer alkyl side chain (7 carbons instead of 5), which allows it to bind more strongly to cannabinoid receptors.

**Key characteristics:**
- Naturally occurring (in trace amounts)
- Potentially 33x more potent than THC at CB1
- Discovered in 2019
- Very limited research
- Found in minute quantities naturally

## Why THCP is So Potent

The potency difference comes from molecular structure:

- **Delta-9-THC:** 5-carbon side chain
- **THCP:** 7-carbon side chain

The longer chain fits more snugly into CB1 receptors, creating stronger binding and potentially stronger effects.

## THCP Research

The discovery study found:
- Strong CB1 receptor binding affinity
- Produced THC-like effects in mice at lower doses
- May contribute to the varying potency of cannabis strains

However, human studies are essentially non-existent.

## Safety Concerns

**Major unknowns include:**
- Effects at various doses in humans
- Long-term safety
- Interaction with other substances
- Appropriate dosing (given extreme potency)

---

## THCP in Products

Some companies market THCP products, but:
- Natural extraction yields minimal amounts
- Most is likely synthesized
- Quality control is difficult
- Potency makes dosing risky

---

## My Position

THCP concerns me because:
1. Extreme potency makes accidental overdose more likely
2. Almost no human research exists
3. Legal status is unclear
4. Quality of products is questionable

I recommend avoiding THCP products until substantially more research exists.
