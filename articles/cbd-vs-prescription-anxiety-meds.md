**How SSRIs work:**
- Increase available serotonin
- Block serotonin reuptake
- Require consistent use
- Effects build over weeks
- Examples: Sertraline, escitalopram, fluoxetine

### Benzodiazepines

**How benzos work:**

## My Take

This isn't an either/or situation for many people. CBD and prescription medications serve different purposes and have different risk-benefit profiles.

For mild anxiety, CBD may be sufficient and worth trying before escalating to prescriptions. For moderate to severe anxiety disorders significantly affecting your life, prescription medications have stronger evidence and may be necessary.

What I'd caution against: stopping prescribed medications without medical guidance because you want to try CBD instead. Anxiety medications are prescribed for reasons, and abruptly stopping can cause problems. If you want to explore CBD, talk to your prescribing doctor about how to do so safely.

CBD's main advantages are its safety profile and lack of addiction potential. Prescriptions' main advantages are strength of evidence and effectiveness for serious conditions.
