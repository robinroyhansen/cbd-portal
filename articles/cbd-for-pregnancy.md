## My Take

This is one of the clearest situations in CBD guidance: don't use it during pregnancy. I know pregnancy symptoms can be challenging and CBD might seem like a natural solution, but the risks aren't understood well enough.

The precautionary principle applies here. We don't know CBD is dangerous during pregnancy—but we also don't know it's safe. With another human's development at stake, the responsible choice is to avoid it.
