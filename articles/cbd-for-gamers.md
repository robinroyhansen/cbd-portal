## My Take

Gaming and CBD is an interesting combination. The sustained focus and competitive anxiety aspects of gaming align with what CBD may help. But be realistic—CBD won't make you a better player; it may just help with the mental side of performing well.

The physical benefits matter for long sessions. Gaming creates real strain on wrists, hands, and posture that CBD's anti-inflammatory properties may address.
