## The Short Answer

Does CBD help with COVID-19? Based on the 18 studies I have reviewed, there is emerging but unproven evidence for CBD in COVID-19. Some laboratory research suggests CBD may have [anti-inflammatory](/glossary/anti-inflammatory) and potential antiviral properties. However, clinical trials in COVID patients are limited. CBD should not be considered a treatment or prevention for COVID-19. Vaccination and established medical treatments remain the standard of care.

## What the Research Shows

Laboratory studies found that CBD may reduce the "cytokine storm" inflammation associated with severe COVID-19. CBD's [anti-inflammatory](/glossary/anti-inflammatory) properties through the [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) could theoretically help manage excessive immune responses.

Some early studies suggested CBD might reduce viral replication, but subsequent research has shown mixed results. Any antiviral effects require much higher CBD concentrations than typically achievable with consumer products.

Clinical trials testing CBD in COVID patients are limited and results have been inconclusive. The research does not support using CBD to prevent or treat COVID-19.

## My Take

I want to be direct: CBD is not a COVID-19 treatment. While the laboratory research on CBD and inflammation is interesting, it hasn't translated to proven clinical benefits for COVID patients.

If you had COVID and are experiencing long-term effects, some of CBD's general properties (anti-inflammatory, sleep support) might be worth exploring with your doctor. But this is not COVID-specific treatment.
