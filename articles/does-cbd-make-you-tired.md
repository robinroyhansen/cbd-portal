## My Take

Yes, CBD can make you tired—it's one of the most common side effects. But it's dose-dependent and highly individual. If tiredness is a problem, lower your dose or take it in the evening. If you're using CBD for sleep, the sedation is exactly what you want. Know your goals and adjust your approach accordingly.
