## My Take

CBD RSO appeals to those wanting the most complete hemp extract possible—minimal processing, maximum plant compounds. The dark colour and strong taste aren't for everyone, but they indicate a full-spectrum product closer to the whole plant. If you can handle the taste and prefer less refined products, quality CBD RSO is legitimate. But it's concentrated and potent, requiring careful dosing. For most people, standard CBD oil is more practical and pleasant, while still offering full-spectrum benefits.
