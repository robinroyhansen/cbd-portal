## Key Takeaways

1. **No direct evidence** CBD helps vertigo
2. **May help** anxiety and nausea from vertigo
3. **Seek medical evaluation** for vertigo
4. **Evidence-based treatments** available
5. **Focus on proper diagnosis** first

## My Take

I can't recommend CBD as a vertigo treatment—we simply don't have evidence it works. Vertigo needs proper diagnosis because the treatment depends heavily on the cause. For BPPV, the Epley maneuver is highly effective. For other types, different approaches are needed.

If you have vertigo-related anxiety or nausea, CBD might help with those. But get proper vertigo treatment first.
