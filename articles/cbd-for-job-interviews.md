## My Take

CBD can be a helpful tool for managing interview anxiety, particularly the physical symptoms that can undermine your presentation. The key is testing your protocol beforehand—never experiment on interview day.

But CBD supports, it doesn't substitute. The best interview performance comes from preparation plus calm nerves. Use CBD to manage the anxiety while ensuring you've done the work to deserve the confidence.
