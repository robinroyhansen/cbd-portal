## Quick Summary

Distillation is a purification process that separates and concentrates CBD from crude extract based on boiling points. The result is a highly refined CBD distillate with concentrations of 80-90%+, often used in products requiring precise dosing and consistent quality.

## Key Takeaways

- Purifies crude extract to 80-90%+ CBD
- Uses heat and vacuum
- Removes impurities and plant material
- Creates consistent, pure product
- Multiple passes increase purity

---

## How Distillation Works

### The Process

1. Crude extract heated under vacuum
2. Compounds vaporise at different temperatures
3. CBD vapour collected and condensed
4. Impurities separated
5. High-purity distillate produced

### Key Principles

- Boiling point differences
- Vacuum reduces required temperature
- Prevents thermal degradation
- Selective collection

## Types of Distillation

### Short-Path Distillation

- Most common for CBD
- Short distance vapour travels
- Reduces heat exposure
- Produces high-quality distillate

### Wiped Film Distillation

- Thin film for efficiency
- Continuous process possible
- Scalable
- Consistent results

## Distillate Characteristics

### What It Contains

**High-Quality Distillate:**
- 80-95% total cannabinoids
- CBD dominant (if CBD distillate)
- Minor cannabinoids present
- Most terpenes removed

### Appearance

- Golden to amber colour
- Thick, viscous liquid
- Translucent
- Uniform consistency

## Uses of CBD Distillate

### Product Applications

- Vape cartridges
- Edibles and beverages
- Tinctures
- Capsules
- Topicals

### Why It's Popular

- Precise dosing
- Neutral taste
- Versatile
- Consistent potency

## Distillate vs Other Forms

### Comparison

| Form | CBD Content | Terpenes | Processing |
|------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Crude extract | 30-60% | Some | Minimal |
| Distillate | 80-95% | Few/none | Moderate |
| Isolate | 99%+ | None | Highest |

---

## Quality Considerations

### What to Check

- Cannabinoid potency testing
- Contaminant testing
- Residual solvent testing
- Colour and clarity

### Quality Markers

- High CBD percentage
- Low THC (if required)
- Clean testing results
- Professional production

---

## My Take

Distillation is an essential step for many quality CBD products. It removes impurities while concentrating cannabinoids to consistent levels. If terpenes are important to you, look for products that re-introduce them after distillation, as the process removes most of them.
