CBD gummies and capsules are both convenient, pre-dosed CBD formats, but they differ in experience. Gummies taste like candy and are more enjoyable to take, while capsules are tasteless and more like a traditional supplement. Both have similar absorption (oral/digestive), making the choice primarily about personal preference and lifestyle fit.

## My Take

For most practical purposes, gummies and capsules are interchangeable—they both deliver CBD through the same oral route with similar absorption. The choice comes down to: do you want the experience of eating candy, or the simplicity of swallowing a supplement? Gummies make CBD more enjoyable and may help with consistency, but they cost more and have added ingredients. Capsules are straightforward and better value. Try both and see which fits your lifestyle.
