## Quick Summary

Understanding CBD terminology helps you make informed decisions. This glossary defines the most important terms you'll encounter when learning about and shopping for CBD products.

---

## A-C

### Bioavailability
The percentage of CBD that enters your bloodstream. Different methods have different bioavailability—sublingual is higher than edibles.

### Broad-Spectrum CBD
CBD extract containing multiple cannabinoids and terpenes, but with THC removed. Offers entourage effect benefits without THC.

### Cannabidiol (CBD)
The main non-intoxicating compound from cannabis/hemp plants. Interacts with the endocannabinoid system.

### Cannabinoid
Chemical compounds that interact with the body's endocannabinoid system. Both plant-derived (phytocannabinoids) and body-produced (endocannabinoids).

### Carrier Oil
Oil used to dilute CBD extract (MCT oil, hemp seed oil, olive oil). Affects absorption and delivery.

### Certificate of Analysis (COA)
Lab report showing cannabinoid content, potency, and contaminant testing results. Essential for verifying product quality.

### CO2 Extraction
Method using pressurized carbon dioxide to extract CBD from hemp. Considered clean and efficient.

---

## D-F

### Dosage
Amount of CBD taken, typically measured in milligrams (mg).

### Endocannabinoid System (ECS)
Biological system of receptors (CB1, CB2) that interacts with cannabinoids to regulate various body functions.

### Entourage Effect
Theory that cannabis compounds work better together than in isolation—cannabinoids and terpenes enhancing each other's effects.

### Extraction
Process of removing CBD and other compounds from hemp plant material. Methods include CO2, ethanol, and hydrocarbon extraction.

### Full-Spectrum CBD
CBD extract containing all hemp compounds including trace THC (<0.3%), other cannabinoids, and terpenes. Offers full entourage effect.

---

## G-I

### Hemp
Cannabis plant variety containing less than 0.3% THC. Legal source of CBD in the United States.

### Hemp Seed Oil
Oil pressed from hemp seeds. Contains beneficial nutrients but no CBD. Different from CBD oil.

### Isolate
Pure CBD (99%+) with all other compounds removed. No THC, no other cannabinoids, no terpenes.

---

## M-P

### MCT Oil
Medium-chain triglyceride oil, commonly from coconut. Popular carrier oil for CBD due to good absorption.

### Milligram (mg)
Unit of measurement for CBD content. Used for dosing and product potency.

### Non-Detectable (ND)
COA term meaning a compound (usually THC) was not detected at testing threshold. Important for THC-free products.

### Phytocannabinoid
Plant-derived cannabinoid (like CBD, THC). Distinguished from endocannabinoids made by the body.

### Potency
Concentration of CBD in a product, typically expressed as mg per serving or total mg.

---

## S-T

### Sublingual
Administration under the tongue, allowing direct absorption into bloodstream. Faster onset than swallowing.

### Terpenes
Aromatic compounds in plants that contribute to smell and may have therapeutic effects. Found in full and broad-spectrum CBD.

### THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol)
Primary psychoactive compound in cannabis. Legal hemp contains <0.3% THC. Causes the "high" associated with marijuana.

### Third-Party Testing
Independent laboratory testing (not by the CBD company). Verifies product claims and safety.

### Tincture
Liquid CBD extract, typically in a carrier oil, designed for sublingual use.

### Topical
CBD product designed for skin application (creams, balms, lotions). Works locally, not systemically.

---

## Less Common Terms

### Decarboxylation
Heating process that activates CBD and other cannabinoids in raw hemp.

### Ethanol Extraction
Using alcohol to extract CBD from hemp. Common extraction method.

### Flavonoids
Plant compounds with potential antioxidant benefits found in full-spectrum CBD.

### Nanoemulsion
Technology making CBD particles very small for potentially better absorption. Used in some water-soluble products.

### Winterization
Process to remove fats and waxes from hemp extract during refinement.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Understanding terms** helps informed decisions
2. **COA** is essential for verification
3. **Spectrum type** determines what's in product
4. **Bioavailability** affects how much CBD you absorb
5. **Third-party testing** ensures quality

---

## My Take

The CBD industry uses lots of terminology that can be confusing at first. The most important terms to understand are spectrum types (full, broad, isolate), bioavailability (how much you absorb), and COA (how to verify quality).

Don't get overwhelmed by every term—focus on understanding the basics, then learn more as needed. The goal is making informed purchasing decisions, not becoming a cannabis scientist.
