## Basic Questions

### What is CBD?

CBD (cannabidiol) is a naturally occurring compound found in [cannabis](/glossary/cannabis) plants. Unlike [THC](/glossary/thc), CBD doesn't produce a \"high.\" It's extracted primarily from [hemp](/glossary/hemp) and available in various products.

### Is CBD the same as marijuana?

No. CBD is one of many compounds in cannabis plants. Marijuana contains high THC (gets you high); hemp contains high CBD and very low THC (doesn't get you high). Legal CBD comes from hemp.

### Will CBD get me high?

No. CBD is non-intoxicating. You won't experience the \"high\" associated with marijuana. Any psychoactive effect is subtle—calming, perhaps, but not impairing.

### Is CBD legal?

In the US, hemp-derived CBD with less than 0.3% THC is federally legal (2018 Farm Bill). State laws vary. International laws differ significantly.

---

## Safety Questions

### Is CBD safe?

CBD is generally well-tolerated. Side effects are usually mild—fatigue, digestive changes, appetite changes. However, it can interact with some medications.

### Can I overdose on CBD?

No fatal CBD overdose has been reported. High doses may cause unpleasant side effects (fatigue, digestive issues), but it's not dangerous like an overdose of other substances.

### Does CBD interact with medications?

Yes, CBD can interact with many medications through the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. If you take prescription medications, consult your doctor before using CBD.

### Can I take CBD while pregnant or breastfeeding?

Not recommended. Insufficient research on safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The [FDA](/glossary/fda) advises against use during these times.

---

## Usage Questions

### How much CBD should I take?

Start with 20-25mg daily and increase gradually. Effective doses vary widely (10-100+ mg). Factors include body weight, condition being addressed, and individual response.

### How long does CBD take to work?

Depends on the method:
- [Sublingual](/glossary/sublingual) (under tongue): 15-45 minutes
- [Capsules](/glossary/capsules)/edibles: 1-2 hours
- [Topicals](/glossary/topicals): 15-45 minutes locally
- Consistent use often needed for full effects

### When should I take CBD?

Based on your goals:
- Sleep: evening, 1-2 hours before bed
- Anxiety: morning or as needed
- Pain: consistent daily dosing
- General wellness: once or twice daily

### Can I take CBD every day?

Yes, many people use CBD daily for consistent effects. Daily use is generally considered safe for most adults.

---

## Drug Testing Questions

### Will CBD show up on a drug test?

Pure CBD (isolate) shouldn't. However, [full-spectrum](/glossary/full-spectrum) CBD contains trace THC that could potentially cause a positive test with heavy use. If drug tested, use verified THC-free products.

### Which CBD products are safest for drug testing?

[CBD isolate](/glossary/cbd-isolate) products are safest (99%+ pure CBD, no THC). Verified [broad-spectrum](/glossary/broad-spectrum) (THC removed) is second safest. Full-spectrum has THC content and carries some risk.

---

## Product Questions

### What's the difference between full-spectrum, broad-spectrum, and isolate?

- **Full-spectrum**: All hemp compounds including trace THC (<0.3%)
- **Broad-spectrum**: All compounds minus THC
- **Isolate**: Pure CBD only (99%+)

### Which spectrum type is best?

Depends on your needs:
- Drug tested? Isolate or broad-spectrum
- Want maximum benefit? Full-spectrum (entourage effect)
- Sensitive or prefer simple? Isolate

### How do I know if a CBD product is good quality?

Check for:
- [Third-party testing](/glossary/third-party-testing) (COA available)
- CBD amount matches label
- Contaminant testing passed
- Reputable company
- Reasonable price

---

## Effect Questions

### What does CBD feel like?

Subtle for most people—calm, relaxed, potentially less anxious. Not intoxicating or impairing. Many notice more what's absent (anxiety, pain) than what's present.

### Why isn't CBD working for me?

Common reasons:
- Dose too low
- Not enough time (try 2-4 weeks)
- Poor quality product
- Wrong delivery method
- Unrealistic expectations

### Does CBD work for everyone?

No. Individual responses vary significantly. Some people respond well, others minimally. If it doesn't work after proper trial, it may not be right for you.

---

## Legal and Practical Questions

### Can I travel with CBD?

Domestically (US): Generally yes for hemp-derived CBD. TSA allows hemp products.

Internationally: Laws vary dramatically. Some countries prohibit any CBD. Research thoroughly before international travel.

### Where should I buy CBD?

Options include:
- Online (often best selection/prices)
- CBD specialty stores
- Health food stores
- Some pharmacies

Verify quality regardless of where you buy.

## Key Takeaways

1. **CBD doesn't** get you high
2. **Generally safe** but can interact with medications
3. **Start low**, increase gradually
4. **Verify quality** with third-party testing
5. **Individual response** varies—give it fair trial

## My Take

Most CBD questions come down to a few themes: Is it safe? Will it work? How do I use it? The answers are nuanced but not complicated. CBD is generally safe, works for many people for certain things, and requires some experimentation to find your right approach.

The biggest mistake people make is expecting too much too fast. Give CBD a proper trial—quality products, adequate doses, sufficient time—before concluding it does or doesn't work for you.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does CBD stay in your system?

CBD typically clears from your system within 2-5 days for occasional users, but can be detected for up to 2 weeks with regular use. Factors like dosage, frequency, body weight, and metabolism affect clearance time. Most standard drug tests don't screen for CBD specifically, but full-spectrum products containing trace THC could potentially trigger positive results.

### What's the difference between full-spectrum, broad-spectrum, and CBD isolate?

Full-spectrum contains all cannabis compounds including up to 0.3% THC, broad-spectrum has everything except THC, and isolate is pure CBD only. Full-spectrum may provide enhanced benefits through the \"entourage effect\" but carries slight THC risk. Broad-spectrum offers middle ground, while isolate ensures zero THC exposure.

### How much CBD should I take for sleep?

Most people find 25-75mg of CBD taken 30-60 minutes before bedtime effective for sleep. Start with 25mg and increase by 10-15mg weekly until you find your optimal dose. Higher doses (50-100mg) may work better for severe sleep issues, but some people respond well to lower amounts like 10-20mg.

### Can I give CBD to my pets?

Pet-specific CBD products are generally safe for dogs and cats when properly dosed. Use 0.2-0.5mg per pound of body weight, starting at the lower end. Never give human CBD products to pets—they may contain harmful ingredients like xylitol. Always consult your veterinarian before starting CBD, especially if your pet takes medications.

### Does CBD show up on workplace drug tests?

Pure CBD isolate products shouldn't trigger positive drug test results since most tests screen for THC, not CBD. However, full-spectrum CBD products contain trace amounts of THC that could accumulate and cause positive results with regular use. If drug testing is a concern, choose third-party tested isolate or broad-spectrum products with zero THC.
