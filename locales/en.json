CBD can inhibit certain CYP enzymes (especially CYP3A4 and CYP2C19), which can slow down how your body processes certain drugs. This may lead to higher levels of the medication in your blood.",
    "faqStopMedication": "Should I stop my medication to use CBD?",

    "faqDifferentTime": "Can I take CBD at a different time than my medication?",
    "faqDifferentTimeAnswer": "While spacing CBD and medications apart may reduce some interactions, it doesn't eliminate them. CBD has a long half-life and its effects on liver enzymes can persist. Always consult your healthcare provider about timing strategies.",
