The 2-AG Degrading Enzyme","content":"By Robin Roy Krigslund-Hansen | 12+ years in [CBD](/glossary/cannabidiol) industry\nLast updated: January 2026\n\n---\n\n## Quick Answer\n\n**MAGL (monoacylglycerol lipase)** is the enzyme responsible for breaking down [2-AG](/glossary/2-ag), the most abundant [endocannabinoid](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) in the brain. While [FAAH](/glossary/faah-enzyme) degrades [anandamide](/glossary/anandamide), MAGL handles 2-AG—making these two enzymes the primary regulators of [endocannabinoid tone](/glossary/endocannabinoid-tone). MAGL inhibition is being researched for [pain](/conditions/pain), [inflammation](/conditions/inflammation), and neuroprotection.\n\n---\n\n## What Is MAGL?\n\nMAGL (also written as MGL or MGLL) is a serine hydrolase enzyme that terminates 2-AG signaling by breaking it down into arachidonic acid and glycerol.\n\n### MAGL Quick Facts\n\n| Property | Detail |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Full name** | Monoacylglycerol lipase |\n| **Gene** | MGLL |\n| **Primary substrate** | [2-AG](/glossary/2-ag) (2-arachidonoylglycerol) |\n| **Location** | Brain, liver, adipose tissue |\n| **Function** | Degrades 2-AG, terminates signaling |\n| **Comparison** | MAGL is to 2-AG as FAAH is to anandamide |\n\n---\n\n## How MAGL Works\n\n### The 2-AG Lifecycle\n\n| Stage | Process |\n|-------|---------|\n| **1.

MAGL controls 2-AG levels, which make up about 85% of brain endocannabinoids. That's huge.\n\nThe most common question I get is \"Why can't I just take 2-AG supplements?\" The answer is MAGL—it would break down any 2-AG before it could work. This is why researchers [focus](/conditions/focus) on MAGL inhibitors instead, though none are commercially available yet.\n\nWhat fascinates me is how cannabis compounds interact with this system. While [CBD](/glossary/cannabidiol) and [THC](/glossary/thc) don't directly inhibit MAGL like they do FAAH, they can indirectly influence 2-AG signaling through the [CB1](/glossary/cb1-receptor) and [CB2 receptors](/glossary/cb2-receptor). Understanding this enzyme helped me grasp why some CBD products work better for inflammation—they're supporting a system where 2-AG plays a major anti-inflammatory role.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### What does MAGL do?\n\nMAGL is the enzyme that breaks down 2-AG, the most abundant endocannabinoid in the brain. By degrading 2-AG, MAGL controls how long endocannabinoid signaling lasts. Its activity helps maintain [endocannabinoid tone](/glossary/endocannabinoid-tone).\n\n### How is MAGL different from FAAH?\n\n[FAAH](/glossary/faah-enzyme) primarily breaks down [anandamide](/glossary/anandamide), while MAGL breaks down [2-AG](/glossary/2-ag). They're located in different parts of the synapse and affect different aspects of endocannabinoid signaling. Both are drug development targets.\n\n### Does CBD affect MAGL?\n\nCBD's interaction with MAGL is minimal and controversial. CBD primarily affects [FAAH](/glossary/faah-enzyme) (preserving anandamide), not MAGL. Some studies suggest very weak MAGL effects, but this isn't considered a primary CBD mechanism.\n\n### Are there MAGL inhibitor drugs?\n\nNo MAGL inhibitors are currently approved for medical use. ABX-1431 has entered human clinical trials. Research compounds like JZL184 are used in laboratories to study MAGL's role in various conditions.\n\n### Why is MAGL important for inflammation?\n\nWhen MAGL breaks down 2-AG, it produces arachidonic acid—the precursor to inflammatory prostaglandins. Inhibiting MAGL reduces arachidonic acid availability and enhances anti-inflammatory 2-AG signaling, providing dual anti-inflammatory effects.\n\n---\n\n**Medical Disclaimer:** This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.
