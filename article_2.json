Understanding how these receptors work explains why [THC](/glossary/thc) gets you high, why CBD doesn't, and how both might have therapeutic effects.\n\n---\n\n## Research Snapshot\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Studies reviewed | 100 |\n| Human clinical trials | 98 |\n| Systematic reviews | 1 |\n| Preclinical studies | 1 |\n| Total participants | 163+ |\n| Evidence strength | ●●●○○ Moderate |\n\n*Research on CBD and cannabinoids continues to evolve. [Browse all studies](/research)*\n\n## Quick Answer\n\n**CB1 receptors** are concentrated in the brain and central [nervous system](/conditions/nervous-system). When [THC](/articles/what-is-thc) activates them, it produces the \"high\" and affects memory, coordination, [pain](/conditions/pain), and [mood](/conditions/mood). **CB2 receptors** are found mainly in immune cells and peripheral tissues. They modulate [inflammation](/conditions/inflammation) and immune responses. [CBD](/articles/what-is-cannabidiol) doesn't strongly activate either receptor directly but influences the system through other mechanisms.\n\n## Key Numbers: CB1 and CB2 Receptor Discovery\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| CB1 receptor discovery | 1988 |\n| CB2 receptor discovery | 1993 |\n| Years between discoveries | 5 years |\n\nThese discoveries laid the foundation for understanding how cannabinoids interact with the human body's endocannabinoid system.\n\n## Key Differences\n\n| Factor | CB1 | CB2 |\n|--------|-----|-----|\n| **Location** | Brain, CNS | Immune system, peripheral |\n| **THC effect** | Strong (causes high) | Moderate |\n| **CBD effect** | Weak/indirect | Weak/indirect |\n| **Main functions** | Mood, memory, pain | Immunity, inflammation |\n| **Discovery** | 1988 | 1993 |\n\n## CB1 Receptors\n\n### Where They're Found\n\nCB1 receptors are among the most abundant receptors in the brain:\n\n**High concentration:**\n- Basal ganglia (movement)\n- Cerebellum (coordination)\n- Hippocampus (memory)\n- Cerebral cortex (thinking)\n- Hypothalamus (appetite)\n\n**Lower concentration:**\n- Spinal cord\n- Some peripheral tissues\n- Reproductive organs\n- Fat cells\n- Liver\n\n**Notably absent:**\n- Brain stem (controls breathing) — this is why cannabis overdose doesn't stop breathing\n\n### What CB1 Does\n\nWhen activated, CB1 receptors regulate:\n\n**In the brain:**\n- Neurotransmitter release (GABA, glutamate)\n- Pain perception\n- Memory formation\n- Mood and emotion\n- [Appetite](/conditions/appetite)\n- Movement coordination\n\n**Peripherally:**\n- Some metabolic effects\n- Fat storage\n- Liver function\n\n### Why THC Works on CB1\n\nTHC is a partial agonist at CB1 receptors:\n\n- Fits into the receptor binding site\n- Activates the receptor (but not fully)\n- Mimics [anandamide](/articles/anandamide) (natural endocannabinoid)\n- Longer-lasting than [anandamide](/glossary/anandamide)\n\n**This produces:**\n- Euphoria (high)\n- Altered perception\n- Memory impairment\n- Changed time perception\n- Appetite increase\n- Pain reduction\n- Coordination effects\n\n### Why CBD Doesn't Activate CB1\n\nCBD has very weak affinity for CB1:\n\n- Doesn't fit the binding site well\n- No direct activation\n- May actually block THC slightly\n- Works through other mechanisms\n\nThis is why CBD doesn't get you high — it doesn't effectively activate CB1.\n\n## CB2 Receptors\n\n### Where They're Found\n\nCB2 receptors are primarily on immune cells:\n\n**High concentration:**\n- B cells and T cells\n- Macrophages\n- Natural killer cells\n- Spleen\n- Tonsils\n- Thymus\n\n**Also found in:**\n- Gastrointestinal tract\n- Peripheral nervous system\n- Bone cells\n- Skin\n- Some brain regions (microglia)\n\n### What CB2 Does\n\nCB2 receptors primarily regulate immune function:\n\n**Inflammation:**\n- Modulates cytokine release\n- Affects immune cell migration\n- Can reduce inflammatory response\n\n**Pain:**\n- Peripheral pain modulation\n- May reduce [neuropathic pain](/conditions/neuropathic_pain)\n- Works differently than CB1\n\n**Bone:**\n- Affects bone formation\n- Involved in bone resorption\n- Potential osteoporosis relevance\n\n**Gut:**\n- Modulates gut inflammation\n- May affect motility\n- IBD research target\n\n### THC and CB2\n\nTHC also activates CB2:\n\n- Partial agonist (like CB1)\n- Contributes to immune effects\n- May help with inflammation\n- Less studied than CB1 effects\n\n### CBD and CB2\n\nCBD's CB2 relationship is complex:\n\n- Very weak direct binding\n- May act as inverse agonist\n- Modulates rather than activates\n- Effects are indirect\n\n## How Receptor Activation Works\n\n### The Basics\n\nCB1 and CB2 are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs):\n\n1. Cannabinoid binds to receptor\n2. Receptor changes shape\n3. G proteins inside cell activate\n4. Cascade of cellular effects\n5. Enzyme production changes\n6. Cell behaviour alters\n\n### Agonists vs Antagonists\n\n| Type | Effect | Examples |\n|------|--------|----------|\n| **Full agonist** | Maximum activation | Some synthetic cannabinoids |\n| **Partial agonist** | Moderate activation | THC, anandamide |\n| **Neutral antagonist** | Blocks activation | Research compounds |\n| **Inverse agonist** | Reduces activity | Rimonabant (withdrawn) |\n\nTHC is a partial agonist — it activates receptors but not fully. This may be why it's safer than full synthetic agonists.\n\n## Other Cannabinoid Targets\n\nBeyond CB1 and CB2, cannabinoids interact with:\n\n### GPR55\n\nSometimes called \"CB3\":\n- Present in brain and peripheral tissues\n- CBD may be an antagonist\n- Involved in bone health, [blood pressure](/conditions/blood_pressure)\n- Still being characterised\n\n### TRPV1\n\nVanilloid receptor (also responds to capsaicin):\n- CBD activates TRPV1\n- Involved in pain sensing\n- Temperature regulation\n- May explain CBD's pain effects\n\n### 5-HT1A\n\n[Serotonin](/conditions/serotonin) receptor:\n- CBD activates at high doses\n- Important for [anxiety](/conditions/anxiety) effects\n- Mood regulation\n- May explain anti-anxiety effects\n\n### PPARs\n\nNuclear receptors affecting gene expression:\n- CBD interacts with PPARγ\n- Affects metabolism\n- Involved in inflammation\n- May have neuroprotective effects\n\n## Receptor Differences Across the Body\n\n### Brain Region Differences\n\n| Region | CB1 Density | Function Affected |\n|--------|-------------|-------------------|\n| Hippocampus | Very high | Memory |\n| Basal ganglia | Very high | Movement |\n| Cerebellum | High | Coordination |\n| Prefrontal cortex | Moderate | Decision-making |\n| Amygdala | Moderate | Fear, emotion |\n| Brain stem | Very low | Basic functions (protected) |\n\n### Why It Matters\n\nThe distribution explains THC's effects:\n- High CB1 in hippocampus → memory impairment\n- High CB1 in basal ganglia → movement effects\n- Low CB1 in brain stem → can't stop breathing\n\n## Individual Variations\n\nPeople differ in their CB1/CB2 systems:\n\n### Genetic Factors\n- Receptor density varies\n- Enzyme levels differ\n- Some have \"underactive\" systems\n- May explain different responses to cannabis\n\n### Gender Differences\n- Women may have more CB1 receptors\n- Hormonal influences\n- Different sensitivity to cannabinoids\n\n### Age Effects\n- Receptor density changes with age\n- [ECS](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) function may decline\n- May affect cannabinoid therapy in elderly\n\n## Clinical Implications\n\n### Targeting CB1\n\n**Potential uses:**\n- Pain (reduced signalling)\n- Appetite stimulation (cancer, AIDS wasting)\n- [Nausea](/conditions/nausea)/vomiting\n- Anxiety (complex)\n\n**Concerns:**\n- Psychoactive effects\n- Memory impairment\n- Coordination issues\n\n### Targeting CB2\n\n**Potential uses:**\n- Inflammation (IBD, arthritis)\n- Neuroprotection\n- Bone disorders\n- Pain (peripheral)\n\n**Advantages:**\n- No high (minimal brain presence)\n- Targeted immune effects\n- Fewer CNS side effects\n\n### Why CB2-Selective Drugs Interest Researchers\n\nIf you could make a drug that only affects CB2:\n- Anti-inflammatory effects without high\n- No memory impairment\n- Better side effect profile\n- More acceptable medically\n\nSeveral CB2-selective compounds are in development.\n\n\n## My Take\n\nAfter 12+ years in this industry and reviewing hundreds of studies, I've seen how understanding CB1 and CB2 receptors completely changes how people approach cannabis products. The biggest misconception I encounter is people thinking CBD \"doesn't work\" because it doesn't activate CB1 receptors like THC does. That's actually CBD's superpower—it modulates the system without the psychoactive effects.\n\nWhat fascinates me most is how CB2 receptors explain why so many of my customers find relief from inflammatory conditions. These receptors are your body's natural inflammation control centers, and cannabinoids can fine-tune them. I always tell people: if you're dealing with pain or inflammation, [focus](/conditions/focus) on products that support CB2 activity—you'll likely see better results than chasing the THC high through CB1 activation.\n\nThe endocannabinoid system isn't just about getting high; it's your body's master regulatory network. Understanding this distinction has helped me guide thousands of customers to the right products for their specific needs.\n\n---\n\n## Related Studies\n\nResearch related to this topic:\n\n- [Structural Requirements for Binding of Anandamide-Type Compounds to the Brain Ca...

CB1 activation produces the high. CBD doesn't bind well to CB1 — it works through other receptors and mechanisms that don't cause intoxication.\n\n### Can CBD block THC's effects?\n\nPartially. CBD may act as a weak CB1 antagonist, reducing some of THC's effects. This is why CBD:THC combinations may have fewer side effects than THC alone.\n\n### Are there more cannabinoid receptors?\n\nGPR55 is sometimes called CB3, and there may be others. The system is still being mapped. CBD interacts with many receptors beyond CB1/CB2.\n\n### Do other animals have these receptors?\n\nYes. All vertebrates have CB1 and CB2 receptors. The system is ancient, evolving over 600 million years ago. This is why veterinary cannabinoid use is being explored.\n\n### Can receptors become \"resistant\"?\n\nWith chronic THC use, CB1 receptors can downregulate (decrease in number). This contributes to tolerance. Taking breaks allows receptors to normalise.\n\n### Does CBD affect CB1 or CB2?\n\nCBD has very weak direct effects on both. Its main impacts come from:\n- Inhibiting anandamide breakdown (FAAH)\n- Activating 5-HT1A receptors\n- Modulating TRPV1\n- Other mechanisms\n\n## Sources\n\n1. Matsuda LA, et al. (1990).
