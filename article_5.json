Where you need to be careful is with supplements that have sedative effects (like melatonin or valerian) or blood-thinning properties (like high-dose fish oil). The key is starting with one thing at a time, using quality products, and paying attention to how you feel. When in doubt, consult a healthcare provider.\n\n---\n\n## Related Articles\n\n- [CBD Drug Interactions](/knowledge/cbd-drug-interactions)\n- [Is CBD Safe with Medication?](/knowledge/is-cbd-safe-with-medication)\n- [How to Start Taking CBD](/knowledge/how-to-start-cbd)\n\n---\n\n*This article is for educational purposes only.*\n\n---\n\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### How long should I wait between taking CBD and other supplements?\n\nFor most supplements, no waiting period is necessary since they don't compete for absorption. However, if taking both CBD and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), space them 2-3 hours apart to optimize absorption of each. High-fiber supplements should be taken 1 hour before or after CBD to prevent reduced bioavailability.\n\n### Can I take CBD with pre-workout supplements containing caffeine?\n\nCBD can be combined with caffeine-based pre-workout supplements, and many users find this combination balances [energy](/conditions/energy) with [focus](/conditions/focus). Start with half your usual CBD dose initially, as some people experience increased jitters when combining stimulants with CBD. Monitor your response and adjust accordingly, especially if the pre-workout contains other stimulating ingredients.\n\n### What happens if I take too much CBD with melatonin together?\n\nCombining excessive amounts may cause prolonged drowsiness, grogginess the next morning, and difficulty waking up. If you experience these effects, reduce both supplements by half and gradually find your optimal combination. Most people do well with 1-3mg melatonin plus 10-25mg CBD taken 30-60 minutes before bedtime.\n\n### Are there any protein powders or workout supplements I should avoid with CBD?\n\nAvoid pre-workout supplements containing synephrine or DMAA, as these stimulants may interact unpredictably with CBD. Most protein powders, creatine, and BCAAs are safe to combine. However, if your protein powder contains added herbs like ashwagandha or rhodiola, start with smaller doses since these adaptogens may enhance CBD's calming effects.\n\n### Can I mix CBD oil directly into my morning smoothie with other supplement powders?\n\nCBD oil mixes well in smoothies with most supplement powders, and the fats from ingredients like nut butter or avocado actually improve CBD absorption. Avoid mixing with fiber supplements like psyllium husk, which may reduce CBD uptake. Add CBD oil last and blend briefly to maintain potency, as excessive heat from prolonged blending can degrade cannabinoids.\n\n## Related Studies\n\nResearch related to this topic:\n\n- [Seizure outcomes with cannabidiol (CBD) in pediatric versus adult patients with ...
