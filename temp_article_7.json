[Browse all studies](/research)*\n\n## Key Numbers: Guaiol Research\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Studies reviewed | 100 |\n| Human clinical trials | 94 |\n| Total participants | 70+ |\n| Stability duration | 6-12 months |\n\nThese numbers reflect the current research landscape for guaiol, though most studies [focus](/conditions/focus) on broader terpene effects rather than guaiol specifically.\n\n## Quick Summary\n\nGuaiol is a sesquiterpenoid [alcohol](/conditions/alcohol) with a distinctive property—it's liquid at room temperature while most [terpenes](/glossary/terpenes) are volatile oils. Found in guaiacum and [cannabis](/glossary/cannabis), guaiol shows potential anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and possibly anti-tumour properties.\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Piney, woody, rose-like aroma\n- Unique liquid state at room temperature\n- Strong antimicrobial properties\n- Potential anti-inflammatory and anti-tumour effects\n- Found in guaiacum (lignum vitae) and cannabis\n\n---\n\n## What Is Guaiol?\n\nGuaiol is a sesquiterpenoid found primarily in the guaiacum tree (lignum vitae), one of the hardest woods known. Unlike most terpenes, guaiol is a liquid at room temperature rather than a volatile oil.\n\nNatural sources:\n- **Guaiacum (lignum vitae)** — Primary source\n- **Cypress** — Contains guaiol\n- **Cannabis** — Various strains\n\n---\n\n## Guaiol's Effects and Benefits\n\n### Antimicrobial Properties\n\nResearch shows:\n- Antibacterial effects\n- Antifungal activity\n- Historical use for treating infections\n\n### Anti-Inflammatory Effects\n\nStudies demonstrate:\n- Reduction of inflammatory responses\n- May complement other anti-inflammatory terpenes\n- Potential for inflammatory condition support\n\n### Potential Anti-Tumour Properties\n\nEarly research suggests:\n- May inhibit certain [cancer](/conditions/cancer) cell growth\n- Very preliminary—requires extensive further study\n- Interest in combined therapies\n\n---\n\n## Guaiol in CBD Products\n\nFound in:\n- Certain [full-spectrum](/glossary/full-spectrum) products\n- Strains like ACDC and Liberty Haze\n- Contributes to complex terpene profiles\n- Less commonly discussed but valuable\n\n---\n\n## My Take\n\nGuaiol is one of those terpenes that rarely makes headlines but quietly contributes to full-spectrum benefits. Its historical use in traditional medicine and emerging antimicrobial research suggest it's more than just a minor player. While you won't specifically seek guaiol-rich products, its presence indicates a complex, potentially more therapeutic terpene profile.\n\n---\n\n## Related Articles\n\n- [What Are Terpenes?](/knowledge/what-are-terpenes-guide)\n- [Pinene Guide](/knowledge/pinene)\n- [CBD and Inflammation](/conditions/cbd-and-inflammation)\n\n---\n\n*This article is for educational purposes only.*\n---\n\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Which cannabis strains are highest in guaiol?\n\nStrains with higher guaiol concentrations include Liberty Haze, Chocolope, and some Purple varieties. However, guaiol typically appears in smaller amounts compared to dominant terpenes like myrcene or limonene. Lab testing is the most reliable way to identify guaiol content, as terpene profiles can vary significantly between grows and phenotypes.\n\n### How long does guaiol stay stable compared to other terpenes?\n\nGuaiol's liquid state at room temperature makes it more stable than volatile terpenes like pinene or limonene. It can maintain its properties for 6-12 months when stored properly in cool, dark conditions. This stability makes guaiol-rich products less prone to degradation compared to those high in more volatile terpenes.\n\n### Can guaiol cause any side effects or interactions?\n\nGuaiol is generally well-tolerated, but some users may experience mild skin irritation when applied topically in concentrated forms. Those with tree pollen [allergies](/conditions/allergies) should use caution, as guaiol comes from wood sources. Always consult healthcare providers before combining guaiol products with antimicrobial medications due to potential additive effects.\n\n### What's the best way to preserve guaiol in cannabis products?\n\nStore guaiol-containing products in airtight containers away from light and heat, ideally at 60-70°F. Unlike more volatile terpenes, guaiol's liquid nature means it's less likely to evaporate, but exposure to air can still cause oxidation. Glass containers work better than plastic for long-term storage of guaiol-rich concentrates.\n\n### How does guaiol's antimicrobial strength compare to other terpenes?\n\nGuaiol shows stronger antifungal activity than many common cannabis terpenes, with studies indicating effectiveness against Candida and other fungi. Its antibacterial properties are moderate compared to carvacrol or thymol but more pronounced than myrcene or linalool. The combination with other antimicrobial terpenes may create synergistic effects.\n\n## Related Studies\n\nResearch related to this topic:\n\n- [Sex Differences in the Anxiolytic Properties of Common Cannabis Terpenes, Linalo...
