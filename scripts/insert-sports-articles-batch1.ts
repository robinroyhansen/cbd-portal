## The Short Answer

There's no research specifically on CBD for martial arts. However, martial artists face challenges — inflammation, joint stress, muscle soreness, and recovery demands — that overlap with conditions where CBD research does exist. I'll walk you through what we know from pain and inflammation studies and how it might apply to your training.

## Why Martial Artists Are Interested in CBD

Combat sports put unique demands on the body. Whether you train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, boxing, or MMA, you're dealing with:

- **Joint stress** from grappling, submissions, and repeated impacts
- **Muscle inflammation** from high-intensity training
- **Recovery challenges** between sessions
- **Minor injuries** that accumulate over time
- **Sleep disruption** affecting recovery

The [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) plays a role in regulating pain, inflammation, and sleep — all relevant to martial artists.

---

## What Related Research Shows

### Pain and Inflammation Studies

A [2016 animal study](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016) found that transdermal CBD reduced inflammation and pain-related behaviors in an arthritis model. While this wasn't tested on martial artists, the mechanism — reducing inflammatory markers — is relevant to training-induced inflammation.

A [2020 review](/research/study/2020-cannabidiol-for-pain-mlost-2020) examined CBD's potential for pain treatment, noting its interaction with multiple receptor systems involved in pain perception.

### Muscle Recovery Research

A [2023 pilot study](/research/study/a-randomized-double-blind-placebo-controlled-repeated-dose-p-2023-2defcb) specifically looked at CBD and CBG for delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). This randomized, placebo-controlled trial is directly relevant to martial artists who experience significant muscle soreness after training.

### Exercise and the Endocannabinoid System

A [2003 study](/research/study/exercise-activates-the-endocannabinoid-sparling-2003) found that exercise activates the endocannabinoid system. This suggests your body already uses this system during training — CBD may support what your body naturally does.

---

## Studies Worth Knowing

### CBD Cream for Athletes (2025)

A [randomized, crossover trial](/research/study/cbd-pain-lpez-2025) tested CBD cream on chronic tendon pain in triathletes, runners, cyclists, and swimmers. Athletes applied either CBD cream or placebo for one month each.

**Why it matters for martial artists:** This is one of the few studies testing topical CBD on athletic populations. Tendon issues are common in martial arts from repetitive gripping and striking.

### Fibromyalgia Trial (2024)

The [CANNFIB trial](/research/study/cbd-sleep-amris-2024) tested CBD on 200 patients with fibromyalgia over 24 weeks, measuring pain, sleep, and function.

**Key finding:** 200 participants in a well-designed RCT examining chronic pain conditions.

**Why it matters:** While not martial arts-specific, this represents high-quality evidence for CBD's effects on chronic pain and sleep — both relevant to fighters.

---

## How CBD Might Help Martial Artists

Based on related research, CBD may work through several mechanisms relevant to combat sports:

1. **Anti-inflammatory action** — CBD interacts with [CB2 receptors](/glossary/cb2-receptor) found in immune cells, potentially reducing training-induced inflammation

2. **Pain modulation** — Through the [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) and other pathways like TRPV1 receptors

3. **Sleep support** — Some research suggests CBD may improve sleep quality, crucial for recovery

4. **Muscle relaxation** — Anecdotal reports suggest CBD may help with post-training tension

---

## What Dosages Have Been Studied

No dosages have been studied specifically for martial arts. From related research:

- **Topical applications:** Studies have used various concentrations for localized application
- **Oral CBD:** Pain studies have tested ranges from 15mg to 300mg daily
- **The [2023 DOMS study](/research/study/a-randomized-double-blind-placebo-controlled-repeated-dose-p-2023-2defcb)** used a CBD/CBG combination for muscle soreness

Use our [dosage calculator](/tools/dosage-calculator) as a starting point, but remember these aren't evidence-based recommendations for martial arts specifically.

---

## My Take

Having reviewed the available research on CBD for pain, inflammation, and recovery — and applying it to what martial artists experience — here's my honest assessment:

The direct evidence for CBD in martial arts doesn't exist yet. But the related research is genuinely interesting. Studies on inflammation, chronic pain, and now athletic recovery suggest mechanisms that could benefit fighters.

What I find most promising is the [2023 DOMS study](/research/study/a-randomized-double-blind-placebo-controlled-repeated-dose-p-2023-2defcb) and the [2025 athlete tendon pain trial](/research/study/cbd-pain-lpez-2025). These are getting closer to what martial artists actually experience.

If I trained martial arts, I'd consider trying topical CBD for localized soreness and see if it helps. The risk profile is low. But I wouldn't expect dramatic results — the evidence just isn't there yet to promise that.

I'm watching for more athletic-specific research, particularly on combat sports populations.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can CBD cure injuries from martial arts?

No. CBD is not a treatment for injuries. If you're injured, see a healthcare professional. CBD might help with recovery comfort, but it won't heal torn ligaments or broken bones.

### Will CBD show up on a drug test?

Pure CBD isolate shouldn't, but [full-spectrum CBD](/glossary/full-spectrum-cbd) products contain trace THC that could potentially trigger a positive test. If you compete in tested sports, use CBD isolate or broad-spectrum products and verify third-party testing.

### Is CBD legal in martial arts competitions?

The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) removed CBD from its prohibited list in 2018. However, THC remains prohibited. Check your specific organization's rules, as they may vary.

### Should I use CBD oil or topical CBD for martial arts?

For localized soreness (specific joints or muscles), topical application makes sense based on the [transdermal research](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016). For general recovery and sleep support, oral CBD oil is more commonly studied.

### How long before training should I take CBD?

There's no research-based answer. CBD oil typically takes 30-90 minutes for effects when taken orally. Topicals may work faster for localized application. Experiment during training, not before competition.

## The Short Answer

No studies have tested CBD specifically on golfers. However, golf places significant demands on joints — particularly the back, shoulders, elbows, and wrists — and many golfers deal with chronic pain conditions where CBD research exists. I'll explain what we know from related studies and how it might apply to your game.

## Research Snapshot

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Direct golf studies** | 0 |
| **Related pain/joint studies** | 20+ |

| **Strongest evidence for** | Joint inflammation, arthritis pain |
| **Evidence strength** | ●●○○○ Limited (applied from related research) |

---

## Why Golfers Are Interested in CBD

Golf may look low-impact, but it creates specific physical challenges:

- **Repetitive swing mechanics** stress the back, shoulders, and wrists
- **Walking 18 holes** puts strain on knees, hips, and feet
- **Golfer's elbow** (medial epicondylitis) is a common overuse injury
- **Lower back pain** affects a large percentage of amateur golfers
- **Age-related joint issues** — golf's demographic skews older

The [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) regulates pain perception and inflammation, which is why golfers have become interested in CBD.

---

## What Related Research Shows

### Arthritis and Joint Pain Studies

A [2025 clinical trial](/research/study/cbd-arthritis-mojoli-2025) tested CBD-rich cannabis oil on knee osteoarthritis — directly relevant to golfers with joint issues. This double-blind, placebo-controlled study examined both pain relief and safety.

A [2024 trial](/research/study/cbd-arthritis-cooper-2024) evaluated CBD safety and tolerability in rheumatoid arthritis patients. While golf-related joint pain differs from RA, the research on joint inflammation is applicable.

The [2016 transdermal CBD study](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016) showed reduced inflammation and pain behaviors in an arthritis model — suggesting topical CBD might help with localized joint discomfort.

### Thumb and Hand Arthritis

A [2025 randomized controlled trial](/research/study/cbd-pain-research-2025-1) specifically tested topical CBD for thumb basal joint arthritis. This is highly relevant for golfers who experience grip-related hand pain.

---

## Studies Worth Knowing

### Knee Osteoarthritis Trial (2025)

The [CANOA study](/research/study/cbd-arthritis-mojoli-2025) tested CBD-rich cannabis oil in knee osteoarthritis patients using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design.

**Why it matters for golfers:** Knee health is crucial for a stable swing and walking the course. This is one of the most directly applicable studies for golfers with joint concerns.

### Clinical Endocannabinoid Deficiency (2016)

[Russo's research](/research/study/clinical-endocannabinoid-deficiency-reconsidered-russo-2016) on clinical endocannabinoid deficiency suggests some chronic conditions may involve an underactive endocannabinoid system.

**Why it matters:** If you've tried multiple treatments for chronic pain without success, understanding the endocannabinoid system might offer a different perspective.

---

## How CBD Might Help Golfers

Based on related research, CBD may work through mechanisms relevant to golf:

1. **Joint inflammation** — [CB2 receptors](/glossary/cb2-receptor) in joint tissue may respond to CBD, potentially reducing inflammatory processes

2. **Overuse pain** — CBD's interaction with pain pathways could help manage repetitive strain discomfort

3. **Recovery between rounds** — Anti-inflammatory effects might support recovery after playing

4. **Pre-round relaxation** — Some golfers report CBD helps with pre-game nerves, though anxiety research is mixed

---

## What Dosages Have Been Studied

No golf-specific dosing exists. From joint pain research:

- **Topical CBD:** Applied directly to affected joints in several studies
- **Oral CBD:** Arthritis studies have used varying doses
- **The [osteoarthritis trials](/research/study/cbd-arthritis-mojoli-2025)** provide the most relevant dosing information

Use our [dosage calculator](/tools/dosage-calculator) as a starting point. For joint-specific issues, topical application to the affected area is worth considering based on the transdermal research.

---

## My Take

Having reviewed the research on CBD for joint health and pain — and thinking about what golfers specifically deal with — here's my assessment:

The lack of golf-specific research is expected — it's a niche application. But the joint health research is genuinely relevant. The [knee osteoarthritis trial](/research/study/cbd-arthritis-mojoli-2025) and [thumb arthritis study](/research/study/cbd-pain-research-2025-1) address conditions many golfers actually have.

If I were a golfer dealing with joint discomfort, I'd be interested in trying topical CBD on specific problem areas — elbow, wrist, or knee. The [transdermal research](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016) provides a reasonable basis for this approach.

For general wellness or focus, the evidence is much weaker. I wouldn't expect CBD to improve your swing or concentration based on current research.

What I'm watching: More arthritis trials completing in 2025-2026 will give us better data on joint health applications.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will CBD help my golf game?

There's no evidence CBD improves performance, focus, or skill. It may help with recovery and joint comfort, but don't expect it to lower your handicap.

### Is CBD legal on the PGA Tour?

The PGA Tour doesn't prohibit CBD. However, if you compete in events with drug testing, be aware that [full-spectrum products](/glossary/full-spectrum-cbd) contain trace THC. Use isolate or broad-spectrum if this concerns you.

### Should I use CBD oil or cream for golf-related pain?

For specific joint pain (elbow, wrist, knee), topical application makes sense based on the [transdermal research](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016). For general recovery, oral CBD is more commonly studied.

### Can CBD help with golfer's elbow?

No direct research exists on CBD for golfer's elbow specifically. The condition involves tendon inflammation, and the general anti-inflammatory research suggests potential benefit, but this hasn't been tested.

### How long before a round should I take CBD?

No research answers this question. If using topical CBD, applying it 30-60 minutes before playing allows time for absorption. For oral CBD, 1-2 hours before may be reasonable based on general pharmacokinetics.

## The Short Answer

No research has specifically studied CBD for rock climbing. But climbers deal with issues that overlap with studied conditions: finger joint stress, tendon inflammation, muscle fatigue, and chronic hand/forearm pain. I'll walk through what related research suggests and how it might apply to climbing.

---

## Research Snapshot

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Direct climbing studies** | 0 |
| **Related pain/tendon studies** | 15+ |
| **Human clinical trials (related)** | 8+ |
| **Strongest evidence for** | Anti-inflammatory effects |
| **Evidence strength** | ●●○○○ Limited (applied from related research) |

---

## Why Climbers Are Interested in CBD

Rock climbing creates unique physical demands:

- **Finger pulley stress** — The A2 and A4 pulleys take enormous loads during crimping
- **Tendon overuse** — Forearm tendons handle repetitive high-intensity gripping
- **Joint inflammation** — Finger joints experience compressive and shear forces
- **Muscle fatigue and soreness** — Forearms, shoulders, and core work intensely
- **Recovery demands** — Serious climbers train multiple times per week

The [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) is involved in pain perception, inflammation, and tissue recovery — all relevant to climbing.

---

## What Related Research Shows

### Tendon Pain Research

A [2025 trial](/research/study/cbd-pain-lpez-2025) tested CBD cream on chronic tendon pain in endurance athletes. This randomized, crossover study measured pain levels and quality of life in athletes with tendinopathies.

**Why it's relevant:** Climbers frequently develop tendinopathies in the fingers, forearms, and elbows. This is one of the closest studies to climbing-specific issues.

### Hand and Finger Joint Studies

The [2025 thumb arthritis trial](/research/study/cbd-pain-research-2025-1) tested topical CBD specifically for thumb basal joint problems — directly relevant to climbers who stress their hands.

### Muscle Soreness Research

The [2023 DOMS study](/research/study/a-randomized-double-blind-placebo-controlled-repeated-dose-p-2023-2defcb) examined CBD and CBG for delayed onset muscle soreness. This placebo-controlled trial is relevant to post-climbing recovery.

### General Anti-Inflammatory Evidence

The [transdermal CBD arthritis study](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016) demonstrated reduced inflammation with topical application — suggesting potential for localized finger and forearm treatment.

---

## Studies Worth Knowing

### CBD Cream for Athletic Tendon Pain (2025)

The [athlete tendon pain trial](/research/study/cbd-pain-lpez-2025) is particularly relevant for climbers.

**What they did:** Tested CBD cream versus placebo in athletes with chronic tendon pain, using a crossover design where participants tried both treatments.

**Why it matters for climbers:** Tendon issues in fingers and forearms are among the most common climbing injuries. This study directly addresses athletic tendon pain.

### Exercise and the Endocannabinoid System (2003)

[Sparling's research](/research/study/exercise-activates-the-endocannabinoid-sparling-2003) found that exercise activates the endocannabinoid system, increasing anandamide levels.

**Why it matters:** Your body already uses cannabinoid-like compounds during climbing. Understanding this system helps explain why some climbers feel CBD supports their recovery.

---

## How CBD Might Help Climbers

Based on related research, potential mechanisms for climbers include:

1. **Tendon inflammation** — CBD's anti-inflammatory properties might help with overused tendons in fingers and forearms

2. **Joint stress** — The [transdermal research](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016) suggests topical CBD could address finger joint inflammation

3. **Post-climbing recovery** — The [DOMS research](/research/study/a-randomized-double-blind-placebo-controlled-repeated-dose-p-2023-2defcb) supports potential muscle recovery benefits

4. **Skin health** — Some climbers use CBD topicals for hand skin maintenance, though this isn't well-studied

---

## What Dosages Have Been Studied

No climbing-specific dosing exists. From related research:

- **Topical application:** Most relevant for climbers — apply directly to fingers, forearms, or elbows
- **The tendon pain study** used CBD cream applied to affected areas
- **Oral CBD:** General pain studies have used wide-ranging doses

For finger and forearm issues, topical application makes the most sense based on available research. Use our [dosage calculator](/tools/dosage-calculator) as a general starting point.

---

## My Take

Having looked at the research through a climber's lens, here's what I think:

The [tendon pain trial](/research/study/cbd-pain-lpez-2025) is the most directly applicable study I've found for climbing-specific issues. Tendinopathies are climbing's signature injury pattern, and this research specifically addresses athletic tendon pain.

If I climbed seriously, I'd be interested in trying topical CBD on my fingers and forearms after hard sessions. The [transdermal research](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016) gives some basis for this approach, and the risk is low.

What I wouldn't expect: CBD won't prevent pulley injuries, won't replace proper training progression, and won't substitute for rest when you need it. It's potentially a recovery support tool, not a performance enhancer or injury prevention method.

I'm particularly interested in seeing more research on finger joint health — that would be highly valuable for the climbing community.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can CBD prevent climbing injuries?

No. There's no evidence CBD prevents injuries. Proper training load management, adequate rest, and technique development are proven injury prevention strategies. CBD might support recovery, but it won't stop you from getting injured.

### Should I use CBD oil or cream for climbing recovery?

For finger and forearm issues, topical CBD makes more sense based on the [transdermal research](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016). For general recovery and sleep, oral CBD is more commonly studied.

### How soon after climbing should I apply CBD?

No research answers this specifically. Applying topical CBD to stressed areas within an hour or two of climbing seems reasonable, but this hasn't been studied.

### Will CBD help with finger pulley injuries?

Pulley injuries require proper medical evaluation and treatment. CBD has not been studied for pulley healing. Don't use CBD as a substitute for medical care or rest when injured.

### Is CBD banned in climbing competitions?

CBD itself is not prohibited by WADA or major climbing federations. However, [full-spectrum products](/glossary/full-spectrum-cbd) contain trace THC. If you compete in tested events, use isolate or broad-spectrum products.

## The Short Answer

No studies have specifically tested CBD on weightlifters. But strength training creates demands — muscle damage, inflammation, joint stress, and recovery needs — that overlap with conditions where CBD research exists. I'll explain what we know from related studies and how it might apply to lifting.

---

## Why Weightlifters Are Interested in CBD

Strength training creates specific recovery challenges:

- **Muscle damage** — Microtrauma from resistance training requires repair
- **Inflammation** — Acute inflammation is part of the adaptation process
- **Joint stress** — Heavy loads stress shoulders, elbows, knees, and spine
- **Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS)** — The familiar post-workout ache
- **Sleep quality** — Critical for recovery and muscle protein synthesis

The [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) plays roles in inflammation, pain perception, and sleep — all directly relevant to lifters.

---

## What Related Research Shows

### Muscle Soreness Research

The most directly relevant study is the [2023 DOMS trial](/research/study/a-randomized-double-blind-placebo-controlled-repeated-dose-p-2023-2defcb). This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study tested a CBD and CBG beverage powder for delayed onset muscle soreness.

**Why it matters:** DOMS is exactly what weightlifters experience after hard training. This is the closest study to what lifters actually deal with.

### Anti-Inflammatory Evidence

The [2016 transdermal CBD study](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016) demonstrated reduced inflammation in an arthritis model. While weightlifting-induced inflammation differs from arthritis, the anti-inflammatory mechanism is relevant.

The [2003 linalool study](/research/study/2003-antiinflammatory-activity-of-peana-2003) and [2007 humulene research](/research/study/2007-antiinflammatory-effects-of-fernandes-2007) examined terpenes found in [full-spectrum CBD](/glossary/full-spectrum-cbd) products, showing anti-inflammatory properties.

### Pain Management Research

A [2020 review](/research/study/2020-cannabidiol-for-pain-mlost-2020) examined CBD's pharmacology for pain treatment, exploring the multiple receptor systems involved. This provides background on how CBD might address training-related discomfort.

### Exercise and the Endocannabinoid System

[Sparling's 2003 study](/research/study/exercise-activates-the-endocannabinoid-sparling-2003) found that exercise activates the endocannabinoid system. Your body already uses this system during and after training — CBD may support these natural processes.

## Studies Worth Knowing

### CBD/CBG for Muscle Soreness (2023)

The [DOMS pilot study](/research/study/a-randomized-double-blind-placebo-controlled-repeated-dose-p-2023-2defcb) is the most relevant for weightlifters.

**What they did:** Tested a CBD and CBG beverage powder for muscle soreness recovery in a randomized, placebo-controlled design.

**Why it matters:** This directly addresses what weightlifters experience. While it's a pilot study (smaller sample), it's specifically designed for exercise-induced muscle soreness.

### Fibromyalgia and Chronic Pain (2024)

The [CANNFIB trial](/research/study/cbd-sleep-amris-2024) tested CBD on 200 fibromyalgia patients over 24 weeks, measuring pain, sleep, and function.

**Key finding:** Large, well-designed trial on chronic pain conditions.

**Why it matters for lifters:** While not about lifting, this shows CBD's potential effects on pain and sleep in a rigorous trial — both relevant to recovery.

## How CBD Might Help Weightlifters

Based on related research, potential mechanisms include:

1. **Inflammation modulation** — CBD may influence inflammatory processes through [CB2 receptors](/glossary/cb2-receptor), potentially supporting post-workout recovery

2. **Muscle soreness** — The [DOMS research](/research/study/a-randomized-double-blind-placebo-controlled-repeated-dose-p-2023-2defcb) suggests CBD may help with exercise-induced soreness

3. **Joint support** — The [transdermal research](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016) indicates potential for joint-related inflammation

4. **Sleep quality** — Some research suggests CBD may support sleep, crucial for recovery and muscle growth

## What Dosages Have Been Studied

No weightlifting-specific dosing exists. From related research:

- **The [DOMS study](/research/study/a-randomized-double-blind-placebo-controlled-repeated-dose-p-2023-2defcb)** used a CBD/CBG combination powder
- **Pain studies** have tested wide-ranging oral doses
- **Topical applications** are less studied for muscle soreness specifically

For muscle recovery, oral CBD taken post-workout or before bed is most commonly used by athletes. For joint-specific issues, topical application may also be relevant.

## My Take

Having reviewed the research with weightlifters in mind, here's my honest assessment:

The [DOMS study](/research/study/a-randomized-double-blind-placebo-controlled-repeated-dose-p-2023-2defcb) is the most directly relevant piece of research. It specifically tested CBD for exercise-induced muscle soreness — exactly what lifters deal with. It's a pilot study, so the evidence isn't definitive, but it's a genuine starting point.

I think the most reasonable applications for lifters are:
1. Post-workout recovery support (based on the DOMS research)
2. Sleep support to enhance recovery (based on broader CBD research)
3. Topical application to stressed joints (based on transdermal research)

What I wouldn't expect: CBD won't increase your strength, won't build more muscle, and won't replace proper nutrition, sleep, or programming. It's potentially a recovery support tool.

I'm watching for more athletic-specific research. The [tendon pain trial](/research/study/cbd-pain-lpez-2025) and ongoing muscle recovery studies may provide more applicable data.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will CBD help me build more muscle?

No evidence suggests CBD increases muscle growth. It may support recovery, which indirectly supports training capacity, but don't expect direct muscle-building effects.

### Can CBD improve my lifting performance?

There's no evidence CBD improves strength, power, or endurance performance. Focus on training, nutrition, and sleep for performance gains.

### Is CBD banned in powerlifting or bodybuilding?

CBD itself is not prohibited by most federations. However, [full-spectrum CBD](/glossary/full-spectrum-cbd) contains trace THC that could trigger a positive test. If you compete in tested federations, use isolate or broad-spectrum products.

### When should I take CBD for recovery?

No research provides optimal timing. Common approaches include taking CBD post-workout or before bed to support sleep-dependent recovery. Experiment to find what works for you.

### CBD oil or topical for lifting recovery?

For general muscle soreness and sleep, oral CBD is most commonly studied. For specific joint issues (shoulder, elbow, knee), topical application may help based on the [transdermal research](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016).
