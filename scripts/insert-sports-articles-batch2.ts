## The Short Answer

No research has specifically studied CBD for surfing. But surfers deal with issues that overlap with studied conditions: shoulder stress, lower back pain, muscle fatigue, and inflammation from repetitive paddling. I'll explain what related research suggests and how it might apply to your time in the water.

## Why Surfers Are Interested in CBD

Surfing creates specific physical demands:

- **Shoulder strain** — Paddling puts repetitive stress on rotator cuffs
- **Lower back stress** — The arched position while paddling and duck diving
- **Hip and knee strain** — From pop-ups and maneuvering on the board
- **Muscle fatigue** — Paddling muscles work intensely during sessions
- **Cold water exposure** — Potential for muscle stiffness and cramping

The [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) is involved in pain perception, inflammation, and muscle recovery — all relevant to surfers.

---

## What Related Research Shows

### Muscle Soreness Research

The [2023 DOMS study](/research/study/a-randomized-double-blind-placebo-controlled-repeated-dose-p-2023-2defcb) tested CBD and CBG for delayed onset muscle soreness. This randomized, placebo-controlled trial is relevant to the muscle fatigue surfers experience after long sessions.

### Tendon and Shoulder Studies

A [2025 trial](/research/study/cbd-pain-lpez-2025) tested CBD cream on chronic tendon pain in endurance athletes including swimmers. Given surfing's shoulder demands, this research is directly relevant.

### Anti-Inflammatory Evidence

The [2016 transdermal CBD study](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016) demonstrated reduced inflammation with topical application — potentially relevant for shoulder and back application after surfing.

### Exercise and Recovery

[Sparling's 2003 research](/research/study/exercise-activates-the-endocannabinoid-sparling-2003) found that exercise activates the endocannabinoid system. Your body uses this system during physical activity — CBD may support these natural processes.

---

## Studies Worth Knowing

### CBD Cream for Athletic Tendon Pain (2025)

The [athlete tendon pain trial](/research/study/cbd-pain-lpez-2025) included swimmers and tested CBD cream for chronic tendon issues.

**Why it matters for surfers:** Swimming and paddling share similar shoulder mechanics. This is one of the closest studies to surfing-specific issues.

### Fibromyalgia Trial (2024)

The [CANNFIB trial](/research/study/cbd-sleep-amris-2024) tested CBD on 200 patients with chronic pain over 24 weeks, measuring pain, sleep, and function.

**Why it matters:** While not surfing-specific, this large trial shows CBD's potential for chronic pain conditions that might develop from years of surfing.

---

## How CBD Might Help Surfers

Based on related research, potential mechanisms include:

1. **Shoulder recovery** — The [tendon research](/research/study/cbd-pain-lpez-2025) suggests CBD cream might help with paddling-related shoulder stress

2. **Muscle recovery** — The [DOMS study](/research/study/a-randomized-double-blind-placebo-controlled-repeated-dose-p-2023-2defcb) supports potential benefits for post-session soreness

3. **Back support** — Topical application based on [transdermal research](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016) may help with lower back discomfort

4. **Sleep quality** — Better sleep supports recovery between sessions

---

## What Dosages Have Been Studied

No surfing-specific dosing exists. From related research:

- **Topical application:** For shoulders and back after sessions
- **The [athlete tendon study](/research/study/cbd-pain-lpez-2025)** used CBD cream on affected areas
- **Oral CBD:** General recovery studies have tested various doses

Use our [dosage calculator](/tools/dosage-calculator) as a starting point.

---

## My Take

Having looked at the research through a surfer's lens, here's my honest assessment:

The [tendon pain study](/research/study/cbd-pain-lpez-2025) including swimmers is the most relevant research I've found. Paddling shoulders take similar stress to swimming shoulders, so this research applies reasonably well.

If I surfed regularly, I'd be interested in trying topical CBD on my shoulders and lower back after sessions. The risk is low, and there's some scientific basis for potential benefit.

What I wouldn't expect: CBD won't improve your paddling endurance, won't make you surf better, and won't prevent injuries. It's potentially a recovery support tool, not performance enhancement.

I'm watching for more water sports-specific research as CBD continues to be studied in athletic populations.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will CBD help my surfing performance?

There's no evidence CBD improves athletic performance. It may support recovery between sessions, but don't expect it to make you paddle faster or surf better.

### Is CBD waterproof for use before surfing?

Topical CBD products aren't typically waterproof. Apply after your session rather than before for better absorption and effectiveness.

### Can CBD help with surfer's shoulder?

Surfer's shoulder involves rotator cuff strain and inflammation. The [tendon research](/research/study/cbd-pain-lpez-2025) on swimmers suggests potential benefit, but this specific condition hasn't been studied with CBD.

### Should I use CBD oil or cream for surfing recovery?

For shoulder and back issues, topical application makes sense based on the [transdermal research](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016). For general recovery and sleep, oral CBD is more commonly studied.

### Is CBD banned in surfing competitions?

CBD is not prohibited by the World Surf League or WADA. However, [full-spectrum products](/glossary/full-spectrum-cbd) contain trace THC. If you compete, use isolate or broad-spectrum products.

## Why Hikers Are Interested in CBD

Hiking creates specific physical challenges:

- **Knee stress** — Descents put significant load on knee joints
- **Hip and ankle strain** — Uneven terrain challenges stability
- **Muscle soreness** — Long hikes cause leg muscle fatigue
- **Back strain** — Pack weight stresses the spine
- **Foot discomfort** — Hours of walking creates foot and plantar fascia stress

The [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) regulates pain perception and inflammation, making CBD of interest to hikers.

---

## What Related Research Shows

### Knee and Joint Studies

A [2025 clinical trial](/research/study/cbd-arthritis-mojoli-2025) tested CBD-rich oil on knee osteoarthritis. This is directly relevant to hikers who experience knee discomfort, especially during descents.

The [2016 transdermal CBD study](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016) showed reduced inflammation with topical application — potentially useful for specific joint issues after long hikes.

### Muscle Soreness Research

The [2023 DOMS study](/research/study/a-randomized-double-blind-placebo-controlled-repeated-dose-p-2023-2defcb) tested CBD and CBG for delayed onset muscle soreness. This is relevant to the leg soreness hikers experience after strenuous days.

### Chronic Pain Evidence

The [CANNFIB trial](/research/study/cbd-sleep-amris-2024) tested CBD on 200 patients with fibromyalgia over 24 weeks. While not hiking-specific, it demonstrates CBD's potential for chronic musculoskeletal conditions.

---

## Studies Worth Knowing

### Knee Osteoarthritis Trial (2025)

The [CANOA study](/research/study/cbd-arthritis-mojoli-2025) tested CBD-rich cannabis oil in knee osteoarthritis patients.

**Why it matters for hikers:** Knee health is crucial for hiking, especially on descents. This study directly addresses knee joint issues that many regular hikers develop over time.

### Clinical Endocannabinoid Deficiency (2016)

[Russo's research](/research/study/clinical-endocannabinoid-deficiency-reconsidered-russo-2016) on endocannabinoid deficiency suggests the body's natural cannabinoid system plays a role in chronic conditions.

**Why it matters:** Understanding this system helps explain why some hikers feel CBD supports their recovery.

---

## How CBD Might Help Hikers

Based on related research, potential mechanisms include:

1. **Knee support** — The [osteoarthritis research](/research/study/cbd-arthritis-mojoli-2025) suggests CBD may help with knee joint discomfort

2. **Muscle recovery** — The [DOMS study](/research/study/a-randomized-double-blind-placebo-controlled-repeated-dose-p-2023-2defcb) supports potential benefits for post-hike leg soreness

3. **Joint inflammation** — The [transdermal research](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016) indicates topical CBD may help with localized joint issues

4. **Sleep support** — Better sleep enhances recovery between hiking days

---

## What Dosages Have Been Studied

No hiking-specific dosing exists. From joint and pain research:

- **Topical CBD:** Apply to knees, ankles, or feet after hikes
- **The [osteoarthritis trial](/research/study/cbd-arthritis-mojoli-2025)** provides joint-relevant dosing information
- **Oral CBD:** For general recovery and sleep support

Use our [dosage calculator](/tools/dosage-calculator) as a starting point.

---

## My Take

Having reviewed the research with hikers in mind, here's my honest assessment:

The [knee osteoarthritis research](/research/study/cbd-arthritis-mojoli-2025) is the most relevant study for serious hikers. Knee health is often the limiting factor for long-distance hiking, and this research directly addresses knee joint issues.

If I hiked regularly, I'd be interested in trying topical CBD on my knees after demanding descents. The [transdermal research](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016) provides some basis for this approach.

What I wouldn't expect: CBD won't prevent joint damage, won't make you hike faster, and won't substitute for proper conditioning and technique. It's potentially a recovery support tool.

I'm watching the ongoing arthritis trials — more data on joint health applications would be valuable for the hiking community.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can CBD help with hiker's knee?

Hiker's knee typically involves joint stress and inflammation. The [osteoarthritis research](/research/study/cbd-arthritis-mojoli-2025) suggests potential benefit for knee issues, but this specific condition hasn't been studied with CBD.

### Should I take CBD before or after hiking?

Based on the recovery-focused research, taking CBD after hiking makes more sense. No studies have tested pre-hike CBD use for performance or prevention.

### Will CBD help with altitude-related issues?

There's no research on CBD for altitude sickness or acclimatization. Proper acclimatization protocols remain the standard approach for high-altitude hiking.

### CBD oil or topical for hiking recovery?

For specific joint issues (knees, ankles), topical application makes sense based on the [transdermal research](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016). For general soreness and sleep, oral CBD is more commonly studied.

### Can CBD help with blisters or foot pain?

CBD hasn't been studied for blisters. For foot pain related to inflammation, topical CBD might help based on general anti-inflammatory research, but this is speculative.

## Why Tennis Players Are Interested in CBD

Tennis creates specific physical challenges:

- **Tennis elbow** — Lateral epicondylitis from repetitive forehand/backhand motions
- **Shoulder strain** — Serving puts enormous stress on the rotator cuff
- **Knee and ankle stress** — Quick lateral movements and sudden stops
- **Wrist strain** — Impact absorption during groundstrokes
- **Recovery demands** — Multiple matches in tournaments

The [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) regulates pain perception and inflammation — both central to tennis injuries.

---

## What Related Research Shows

### Tendon Pain Studies

A [2025 trial](/research/study/cbd-pain-lpez-2025) tested CBD cream on chronic tendon pain in athletes. This randomized, crossover study is directly relevant to tennis elbow and other tendinopathies tennis players experience.

### Elbow and Joint Research

A [2022 study](/research/study/pos1021-the-effect-of-cannabidiol-on-quantitative-sensory-te-2022-74dd37) examined CBD's effects on pain parameters in arthritis patients, including hand and joint function — relevant to the wrist and elbow stress tennis creates.

The [2016 transdermal CBD study](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016) showed reduced inflammation with topical application — potentially useful for localized elbow treatment.

### Anti-Inflammatory Evidence

The [2020 review](/research/study/2020-cannabidiol-for-pain-mlost-2020) examined CBD's pharmacology for pain treatment, exploring how it interacts with inflammatory pathways relevant to overuse injuries.

---

## Studies Worth Knowing

### CBD Cream for Athletic Tendon Pain (2025)

The [athlete tendon pain trial](/research/study/cbd-pain-lpez-2025) is particularly relevant for tennis players.

**What they did:** Tested CBD cream versus placebo in athletes with chronic tendon pain, using a crossover design.

**Why it matters for tennis:** Tennis elbow is a classic tendinopathy. This study directly addresses the type of condition tennis players commonly develop.

### Thumb Arthritis Trial (2025)

The [2025 thumb joint study](/research/study/cbd-pain-research-2025-1) tested topical CBD for hand arthritis — relevant to tennis players who experience grip-related hand issues.

---

## How CBD Might Help Tennis Players

Based on related research, potential mechanisms include:

1. **Elbow support** — The [tendon research](/research/study/cbd-pain-lpez-2025) suggests CBD cream might help with tennis elbow

2. **Shoulder recovery** — The same tendon research applies to rotator cuff strain from serving

4. **Wrist and hand support** — The [hand arthritis research](/research/study/cbd-pain-research-2025-1) is relevant for grip-related issues

---

## What Dosages Have Been Studied

No tennis-specific dosing exists. From tendon and joint research:

- **Topical CBD:** Apply to elbow, shoulder, or wrist after play
- **The [tendon pain study](/research/study/cbd-pain-lpez-2025)** used CBD cream on affected areas
- **Oral CBD:** For general recovery and systemic effects

Use our [dosage calculator](/tools/dosage-calculator) as a starting point.

---

## My Take

Having reviewed the research with tennis players in mind, here's my honest assessment:

The [tendon pain trial](/research/study/cbd-pain-lpez-2025) is the most relevant study for tennis-specific issues. Tennis elbow is essentially a tendinopathy, and this research specifically addresses athletic tendon pain.

If I played tennis regularly, I'd be interested in trying topical CBD on my elbow and shoulder after matches. The research provides reasonable basis for this approach, and the risk is low.

What I wouldn't expect: CBD won't prevent tennis elbow, won't improve your serve, and won't substitute for proper technique and conditioning. It's potentially a recovery support tool, not performance enhancement.

I'm particularly interested in seeing research on chronic tendinopathies like tennis elbow — that would be highly valuable for the tennis community.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can CBD cure tennis elbow?

No. CBD is not a cure for any condition. Tennis elbow typically requires rest, physical therapy, and sometimes medical intervention. CBD might support comfort during recovery, but it won't heal damaged tendons.

### Should I use CBD before or after playing?

Based on the recovery-focused research, applying topical CBD after playing makes more sense. No studies have tested pre-match CBD use.

### Will CBD help with serve-related shoulder pain?

The [tendon research](/research/study/cbd-pain-lpez-2025) suggests potential benefit for shoulder tendinopathies. However, shoulder pain should be evaluated by a professional, as it can indicate serious injury.

### Is CBD banned in professional tennis?

CBD is not prohibited by the ATP, WTA, or WADA. However, [full-spectrum products](/glossary/full-spectrum-cbd) contain trace THC. If you compete professionally, use isolate or broad-spectrum products.

### CBD oil or cream for tennis-related pain?

For specific issues (elbow, shoulder, wrist), topical application makes sense based on the [transdermal research](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016). For general recovery, oral CBD is more commonly studied.

## My Take

Having reviewed the research with skiers in mind, here's my honest assessment:

The [knee osteoarthritis research](/research/study/cbd-arthritis-mojoli-2025) is highly relevant for skiers. Knees take tremendous stress during skiing, and many long-term skiers develop knee issues. This research directly addresses knee joint health.

If I skied regularly, I'd be interested in trying topical CBD on my knees and quads after demanding days. The [transdermal research](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016) provides basis for this approach, and combining it with proper recovery practices makes sense.

What I wouldn't expect: CBD won't prevent knee injuries, won't improve your skiing technique, and won't substitute for proper conditioning. It's potentially a recovery support tool.

I'm watching the ongoing knee health research — more data on joint protection and recovery would be valuable for the skiing community.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can CBD help with ski-related knee pain?

The [osteoarthritis research](/research/study/cbd-arthritis-mojoli-2025) suggests CBD may help with knee discomfort. However, knee pain from skiing should be evaluated by a professional, as it can indicate ligament damage.

### Should I take CBD before or after skiing?

Based on the recovery-focused research, taking CBD after skiing makes more sense. No studies have tested pre-skiing CBD use.

### Will CBD help with altitude-related issues?

There's no research on CBD for altitude effects. Proper acclimatization and hydration remain the standard approaches for high-altitude skiing.

### Is CBD legal to bring on ski trips?

CBD products are legal in most places, but regulations vary. Check the laws of your destination. [Full-spectrum products](/glossary/full-spectrum-cbd) contain trace THC, which may be relevant for international travel.

### CBD oil or topical for skiing recovery?

For knee and quad issues, topical application makes sense based on the [transdermal research](/research/study/2016-transdermal-cannabidiol-reduces-hammell-2016). For general soreness and sleep, oral CBD is more commonly studied.
