## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I take CBD oil during my lunch break to help with afternoon work stress?

Taking CBD during lunch can help manage afternoon stress, but start with a low dose (5-10mg) to avoid any drowsiness during work hours. Effects typically begin within 30-60 minutes and last 4-6 hours. Test this approach on weekends first to understand how your body responds before using it during the workday.

### Will CBD show up on a pre-employment drug test for office jobs?

[Full-spectrum](/glossary/full-spectrum) CBD products containing trace THC (up to 0.3%) could potentially trigger a positive drug test result. For pre-employment screening, use only [CBD isolate](/glossary/cbd-isolate) or [broad-spectrum](/glossary/broad-spectrum) products with zero THC and verified lab reports. Allow 2-3 weeks of discontinued use before testing if you've been using full-spectrum products.

### What's the best way to take CBD for chronic neck [pain](/conditions/pain) from computer work?

Combine oral CBD (15-25mg daily) for systemic anti-inflammatory effects with topical CBD cream applied directly to the neck and shoulders 2-3 times daily. Take oral doses in the evening to avoid workplace concerns, and use [topicals](/glossary/topicals) during work breaks. This dual approach targets both [inflammation](/conditions/inflammation) and localized discomfort more effectively.

### How long does it take for CBD to help with work-related sleep problems?

Sleep improvements from CBD typically occur within 1-2 weeks of consistent use. Take 20-30mg about 1-2 hours before bedtime to allow proper absorption. Some people notice better sleep quality within a few days, but establishing a regular sleep pattern after chronic work stress usually requires 2-4 weeks of consistent dosing.

### Can I use CBD gummies at work without my coworkers noticing?

CBD gummies are discreet and look like regular vitamins or candy, making them workplace-friendly. However, they take 1-2 hours to take effect and last 6-8 hours, so timing is crucial. Take them before work starts or stick to very low doses (2.5-5mg) during work hours to avoid any potential drowsiness affecting your performance.
