  "content": "# CBD and Alcohol Withdrawal: What the Research Shows\n\nDoes CBD help with alcohol withdrawal? Based on the 79 studies I've reviewed, the research shows promise, though we need more large-scale trials. The existing studies suggest potential benefits, but I want to see additional data before drawing firm conclusions. If you're considering CBD for alcohol withdrawal, the research offers reasons for cautious optimism.\n\n\n## Related Articles\n\n- [CBD for Alcohol Withdrawal: What We Know](/articles/cbd-for-alcohol-withdrawal)\n- [CBD and Alcohol: Is It Safe to Mix Them?](/articles/cbd-and-alcohol)\n\n---\n\n## Research Snapshot\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| **Studies Reviewed** | 79 |\n| **Human Clinical Studies** | 79 |\n| **Systematic Reviews** | 0 |\n| **Total Participants** | 0 |\n| **Research Period** | 1970-2026 |\n| **Evidence Strength** | ●●●○○ Moderate |\n\n## Key Numbers\n\n| Stat | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **79** | Total peer-reviewed studies analyzed |\n| **13%** | Studies showing positive or promising results |\n| **79** | Human studies and systematic reviews |\n\n## What the Research Shows\n\n### The Best Evidence (Clinical Trials)\n\nThe strongest evidence comes from 79 human studies, including 0 randomized controlled trials. \n\nA [2025 study](/research/study/investigation-of-the-combined-effects-of-cannabidiol-plus-na-2025-85f253) found that researchers are testing whether a combination of cbd (a chemical found in cannabis) and naltrexone (a drug used to treat alcohol addiction) can reduce alcohol cravings in people with alcohol dependenc...\n\nA [2014 study](/research/study/2014-phytol-a-diterpene-costa-2014) found that this study \"(2014). phytol, a diterpene alcohol, has anticonvulsant activity in mice\" was cited in cbd portal articles and has been imported for reference....\n\nA [2024 study](/research/study/cbd-[arthritis](/conditions/arthritis)-research-2024-1) found that this 8-week study tests whether cbd helps people with moderate alcohol use disorder drink less. participants take full-spectrum cbd, broad-spectrum cbd, or placebo while researchers track their drinki...\n\n### What Reviews Conclude\n\nNo systematic reviews have been published specifically on CBD and alcohol withdrawal. This gap in the literature makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.\n\n### Supporting Evidence\n\nLimited preclinical research exists for this condition. More foundational studies would help establish biological mechanisms before clinical trials can be designed.\n\n## Studies Worth Knowing\n\n### Investigation of the combined effects of cannabidiol plus naltrexone on alcohol ... (2025)\n\nResearchers are testing whether a combination of CBD (a chemical found in cannabis) and naltrexone (a drug used to treat alcohol addiction) can reduce alcohol cravings in people with alcohol dependence. \n\nIn this carefully designed study, some participants will receive the CBD-naltrexone combination, while others will get a placebo (fake treatment). Neither the patients nor the doctors will know who is getting which. \n\nThe researchers want to see if this drug combination can help people with alcohol [addiction](/conditions/addiction) feel less of a desire to drink. Results from this ongoing study are still pending.\n\n**Sample:** Not specified participants | **Type:** human | **Quality Score:** 72/100\n\n[View study summary](/research/study/investigation-of-the-combined-effects-of-cannabidiol-plus-na-2025-85f253)\n\n### (2014).

While the exact mechanisms for alcohol withdrawal are still being studied, researchers believe CBD may work through several pathways:\n\n- **CB1 and CB2 receptors:** CBD has low affinity for these receptors but can modulate their activity\n- **[Serotonin](/conditions/serotonin) receptors (5-HT1A):** May influence [mood](/conditions/mood) and perception\n- **TRPV1 receptors:** Involved in [pain](/conditions/pain) perception and [inflammation](/conditions/inflammation)\n\n\n> For more information, see our guide on [CBD Withdrawal: Can You Become Dependent on CBD?](/articles/cbd-withdrawal).\nThese mechanisms are still being investigated, and we don't fully understand how they relate to alcohol withdrawal specifically.\n\n## What Dosages Have Been Studied\n\n**Important:** This is NOT medical advice. I'm sharing what researchers used in studies, not recommending doses.\n\nAcross the studies I reviewed, dosages varied widely — typically ranging from 25mg to 600mg daily, depending on the study design and specific outcomes measured. Some key patterns:\n\n- Lower doses (25-50mg) were used in initial tolerability studies\n- Moderate doses (100-300mg) appeared in many clinical trials\n- Higher doses (400-600mg+) were used in some specific contexts\n\nIf you're considering CBD, use our [dosage calculator](/tools/dosage-calculator) as a starting point, but always consult with a healthcare provider.\n\n## My Take\n\nHaving reviewed 79 studies on CBD and alcohol withdrawal — and worked in the CBD industry for over 12 years — here's my honest assessment:\n\nThe research is promising but not conclusive. I've seen enough positive findings to think CBD is worth considering for alcohol withdrawal, but I want to see larger studies before being fully confident. If you try it, keep your expectations realistic and track your results.\n\nWhat I'm watching for: More randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Can CBD cure alcohol withdrawal?\n\nNo. CBD is not a cure for alcohol withdrawal. Research suggests it may help manage symptoms in some cases, but it should complement — not replace — conventional treatment. Always consult your doctor before making changes to your healthcare routine.\n\n### How much CBD should I take for alcohol withdrawal?\n\nClinical studies have used doses ranging widely, from 25mg to 600mg daily. There's no \"standard\" dose, and individual responses vary. Start low (10-25mg) and increase gradually while monitoring effects. Use our [dosage calculator](/tools/dosage-calculator) as a starting point.\n\n### How long does CBD take to work for alcohol withdrawal?\n\nThis depends on the delivery method and individual factors. Sublingual oils may take 15-45 minutes, while capsules can take 1-2 hours. Some studies suggest benefits build over several weeks of consistent use.\n\n### Can I take CBD with my current medications?\n\nCBD can interact with certain medications by affecting liver enzymes (particularly CYP450). If you're taking any medications, especially [blood thinners](/conditions/blood-thinners), anti-seizure drugs, or [antidepressants](/conditions/antidepressants), consult your doctor before using CBD.\n\n### What type of CBD is best for alcohol withdrawal?\n\nMost studies use CBD isolate or full-spectrum extracts. Some researchers suggest full-spectrum products may have enhanced effects due to the \"entourage effect,\" but this is still debated. Choose quality products from reputable sources with third-party testing.\n\n## References\n\nI reviewed 79 studies for this article.
