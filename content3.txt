## Using CBD for Interviews

## Key Takeaways

1. **Interview anxiety is common** and manageable
2. **CBD may reduce** nervousness and physical symptoms
3. **Time it right** (45-60 minutes before)
4. **Test thoroughly** before actual interviews
5. **Prepare well** — CBD helps anxiety, not knowledge

---

## My Take

Interview anxiety can make you present as less capable than you are. CBD might help bridge that gap—letting your actual qualifications show through without the anxiety filter.

But remember: CBD takes the edge off anxiety, it doesn't create skills or knowledge. The best interview strategy combines solid preparation with anxiety management. CBD can help with the second part.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I take CBD the night before an interview instead of the morning of?

Taking CBD the night before can help with pre-interview sleep quality but won't provide anxiety relief during the actual interview. CBD's effects typically last 4-6 hours, so nighttime dosing won't carry over to a morning interview. For best results, time your dose 45-60 minutes before the interview itself.

### What CBD product works fastest for sudden interview anxiety?

[Sublingual](/glossary/sublingual) tinctures work fastest, taking effect in 15-30 minutes when held under the tongue for 60-90 seconds. Gummies and [capsules](/glossary/capsules) take 45-90 minutes to work, making timing more challenging. Avoid vaping before interviews as it may leave odors and create unpredictable timing.

### Will employers be able to detect CBD use during my interview?

Quality CBD products contain less than 0.3% [THC](/glossary/thc) and won't cause impairment or obvious signs of use. There's no distinct smell or visible effects like red eyes. However, avoid discussing CBD use unless specifically asked about medications, and never use untested products before important interviews.

### How much CBD should I take if I'm naturally a very anxious person?

Highly anxious individuals often need 20-30mg for interview situations, but start testing with 15mg at least a week before. Some may need up to 40mg, but higher doses risk mild drowsiness. Practice with the exact dose and timing during mock interviews or similarly stressful situations first.

### Can CBD interact with anxiety medications I'm already taking?

CBD can potentially interact with benzodiazepines, SSRIs, and other anxiety medications by affecting how your liver processes them. This could increase side effects or alter medication effectiveness. Always consult your prescribing physician before combining CBD with any anxiety medications, especially before important events like interviews.
