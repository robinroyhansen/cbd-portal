Some users report increased restlessness with certain CBD products, especially those containing stimulating [terpenes](/glossary/terpenes) like [limonene](/glossary/limonene). Start with small doses (5-10mg) to assess your individual response before increasing.\n\n### How long does it take for CBD to work for restless legs?\n\nMost users report feeling effects within 30-90 minutes when using [CBD oil](/glossary/cbd-oil) sublingually, which is why taking it 1-2 hours before typical RLS onset is recommended. Topical CBD creams applied directly to legs may provide faster localized relief within 15-30 minutes. Full therapeutic benefits may take 1-2 weeks of consistent use to develop.\n\n### What's the difference between CBD oil and topical CBD for RLS?\n\nCBD oil taken sublingually provides systemic effects that may help with sleep and overall relaxation, while topical CBD creams target localized leg sensations directly. Many RLS sufferers find combining both approaches most effective - using oil for sleep support and [topicals](/glossary/topicals) for immediate leg discomfort. Topicals won't show up in drug tests since they don't enter the bloodstream significantly.\n\n### Should I use full-spectrum or CBD isolate for restless leg syndrome?\n\n[Full-spectrum](/glossary/full-spectrum) CBD may be more effective for RLS due to the [entourage effect](/glossary/entourage-effect), where [cannabinoids](/glossary/cannabinoid) and terpenes like [myrcene](/glossary/myrcene) work together for enhanced muscle relaxation and sleep benefits. However, if you're concerned about [drug testing](/conditions/drug-testing) or [THC](/glossary/thc) sensitivity, [broad-spectrum](/glossary/broad-spectrum) CBD offers similar benefits without THC. [CBD isolate](/glossary/cbd-isolate) is the least likely to cause any unwanted stimulating effects.\n\n### Can I take CBD with prescription RLS medications?\n\nCBD can interact with common RLS medications including pramipexole, ropinirole, and gabapentin by affecting liver enzymes that metabolize these drugs. This could potentially increase medication levels in your system and cause side effects. Always consult your prescribing physician before adding CBD to your RLS treatment regimen, especially if taking multiple medications.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n- [CBD for Sleep](/conditions/cbd-and-sleep)\n- [CBD for Nerve Pain](/knowledge/cbd-for-nerve-pain)\n- [CBD Before Bed Routine](/knowledge/cbd-before-bed-routine)\n\n---\n\n*This article is for educational purposes only.

If you're adding to water or clear drinks, water-soluble CBD is worth the investment for better mixing. It's a pleasant way to take CBD that integrates into your existing routines.\n\n---\n\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### How long does CBD take to work when added to drinks?\n\nWhen consumed in beverages, CBD typically takes 30-90 minutes to take effect since it must pass through your digestive system. Hot drinks may work slightly faster than cold ones due to increased absorption. Taking CBD drinks with food, especially fatty foods, can slow onset but may increase overall absorption.\n\n### Will heating my drink destroy the CBD?\n\nCBD begins to degrade at temperatures above 320°F (160°C), so normal hot beverages like coffee, tea, or hot chocolate won't damage it. However, avoid adding CBD to boiling liquids - let your drink cool for a minute or two before mixing in your CBD oil to preserve maximum potency.\n\n### How much CBD oil should I add to my morning coffee?\n\nStart with 5-10mg of CBD in your coffee, which is typically 0.25-0.5ml of a standard 1000mg CBD oil. You can gradually increase by 5mg every few days until you find your optimal dose. Most people find 10-25mg effective for daily wellness without causing drowsiness.\n\n### Does CBD change the taste of my drinks?\n\nFull-spectrum CBD oils have a natural hemp flavor that ranges from earthy to slightly bitter, which may be noticeable in mild-tasting drinks. Flavored CBD oils or CBD isolates have less taste impact. Strong-flavored beverages like coffee, chocolate, or fruit smoothies typically mask any hemp taste effectively.\n\n### Can I make CBD ice cubes or freeze CBD drinks?\n\nFreezing doesn't damage CBD, so you can make CBD ice cubes or freeze CBD beverages without losing potency. However, oil-based CBD may separate when frozen and thawed, so you'll need to stir well before drinking. Water-soluble CBD products work better for frozen applications.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n- [Water-Soluble CBD](/knowledge/water-soluble-cbd)\n- [CBD Coffee Guide](/knowledge/cbd-coffee-guide)\n- [Can I Add CBD to Food?](/knowledge/can-i-add-cbd-to-food)\n\n---\n\n*This article is for educational purposes only.*\n\n---\n\n**Medical Disclaimer:** This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

Even small amounts of [CBD oil](/glossary/cbd-oil) can lead to imprisonment ranging from several months to years, plus deportation and permanent entry bans.\n\n### Can I buy CBD products locally in Vientiane or Luang Prabang?\n\nNo legitimate CBD retailers operate in Laos since all cannabis products remain illegal. While you might encounter cannabis in certain tourist restaurants or hear about underground sources, these are illegal operations that put both sellers and buyers at serious legal risk.\n\n### Are there medical marijuana exemptions for CBD in Laos?\n\nLaos has no medical marijuana program or legal framework allowing CBD use for medical conditions. Even with foreign prescriptions or medical documentation, bringing CBD into Laos remains illegal with no recognized exemptions for therapeutic use.\n\n### How do Lao police typically handle foreigners caught with small amounts of CBD?\n\nForeign nationals caught with any cannabis products often face harsher treatment than locals, including immediate detention, consulate notification, and potential for bribes or \"fines.\" Police may use possession charges as leverage, making legal representation essential but expensive.\n\n### What's the difference between hemp-derived CBD legality in Laos versus neighboring countries?\n\nUnlike Thailand which legalized [hemp](/glossary/hemp)-derived products, or Vietnam's limited medical allowances, Laos maintains blanket prohibition on all cannabis derivatives regardless of [THC](/glossary/thc) content or source plant.

Both promote relaxation and present-moment awareness, and combining them can create a deeper, more restorative experience.\n\nThe key is keeping CBD doses low—you want subtle calm, not drowsiness. Yoga requires attention and body awareness, which high CBD doses might diminish. Start lower than your usual dose and see how it affects your practice.\n\nI'd recommend trying CBD with slower, more restorative styles first. Once you know how it affects you, experiment with more active practices. And remember—yoga is effective on its own. CBD is an optional enhancement, not a requirement for a good practice.\n\n---\n\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### How long before yoga class should I take CBD?\n\nFor [CBD oil](/glossary/cbd-oil) or tinctures, take them 30-60 minutes before your yoga session to allow for absorption and onset of effects. If using CBD [capsules](/glossary/capsules), allow 1-2 hours as they take longer to process through digestion. Start with a lower dose (5-10mg) initially to gauge your response before practicing.\n\n### Can CBD make me too relaxed or sleepy during yoga?\n\nCBD shouldn't cause drowsiness during yoga when used appropriately, but high doses or indica-dominant products might promote sleepiness. Stick to 5-15mg for daytime practice and avoid products specifically marketed for sleep. If you feel overly sedated, reduce your dose or switch to a lower concentration product.\n\n### What's the best type of CBD product for yoga practice?\n\nCBD tinctures or oils offer the most control over timing and dosage, making them ideal for pre-yoga use. Topical CBD products can be applied to specific areas like shoulders or lower back before class for targeted support. Avoid [edibles](/glossary/edibles) right before practice as they may cause stomach discomfort during poses.\n\n### Is it safe to drive to yoga class after taking CBD?\n\nCBD is non-intoxicating and shouldn't impair driving ability when used in typical wellness doses (under 25mg). However, everyone responds differently, so test your reaction at home first. Some [full-spectrum](/glossary/full-spectrum) products contain trace amounts of [THC](/glossary/thc), which could theoretically affect some sensitive individuals, though this is extremely rare at standard doses.\n\n### Will yoga studios allow CBD use on their premises?\n\nMost yoga studios don't prohibit CBD use since it's federally legal, but policies vary by location and local laws. Take your CBD before arriving rather than during class to avoid any potential issues. Some studios are embracing \"CBD yoga\" classes, but it's best to check with your specific studio about their policies beforehand.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n- [CBD and Meditation](/knowledge/cbd-and-meditation)\n- [CBD for Stress](/knowledge/cbd-for-stress)\n- [CBD for Muscle Recovery](/knowledge/cbd-for-muscle-recovery)\n\n---\n\n*This article is for educational purposes only.

Results have been mixed but show some promise.\n\n### Inflammation Research\n\nScar tissue can maintain chronic low-level inflammation:\n\nCBD's anti-inflammatory properties are well-documented:\n- Reduces inflammatory cytokines\n- Modulates immune responses\n- May reduce ongoing inflammation in tissues\n\n[CBD and inflammation research →](/knowledge/cbd-and-inflammation)\n\n### Fibrosis Research\n\nScar tissue is a form of fibrosis:\n\nLimited research suggests cannabinoids may affect fibrotic processes:\n- Some studies show effects on fibroblast activity\n- The endocannabinoid system influences wound healing\n- Animal studies on organ fibrosis show varying results\n\nHowever, this research hasn't been applied to scar tissue pain specifically.\n\n### Skin Research\n\nCBD in skin and wound healing has been examined:\n\nResearch on [CBD and skin conditions](/research?topic=skin) shows:\n- Anti-inflammatory effects on skin\n- Possible effects on sebaceous glands\n- Some wound healing properties\n\nWhether these translate to established scar tissue is unknown.\n\n---\n\n## Why Scar Tissue Pain Research Doesn't Exist\n\nSeveral factors explain this gap:\n\n1. **Heterogeneous condition** - Scar tissue pain has many causes and presentations\n2. **Difficult to study** - Hard to standardize for clinical trials\n3. **Niche market** - Less commercial interest than common pain conditions\n4. **Mechanism complexity** - Pain from scars involves multiple pathways\n5. **Treatment overlap** - Researchers focus on broader pain categories\n\n---\n\n## Theoretical Mechanisms\n\nIf CBD were to help scar tissue pain, possible mechanisms include:\n\n### Anti-Inflammatory Effects\n\n- Reducing chronic inflammation in scar tissue\n- Modulating immune cells in scarred areas\n- Decreasing inflammatory pain signaling\n\n### Pain Pathway Modulation\n\n- Effects on [TRPV1 receptors](/glossary/trpv1) involved in pain sensation\n- Modulation of pain signaling through the ECS\n- Potential effects on central pain processing\n\n### Possible Anti-Fibrotic Effects\n\n- Some research suggests cannabinoids affect fibroblasts\n- Could theoretically influence scar tissue remodeling\n- This is highly speculative without specific research\n\n### Topical vs. Systemic Effects\n\n- Topical application might target scar tissue directly\n- Systemic CBD might address pain processing\n- Both approaches are unstudied for scar tissue pain\n\n---\n\n## My Take\n\nHaving searched extensively for research on CBD and scar tissue pain, I have to be honest: **we simply don't know if CBD helps this condition**.\n\nThe theoretical basis exists:\n- CBD has pain-modulating properties\n- Anti-inflammatory effects are documented\n- The endocannabinoid system is involved in wound healing\n\nBut theory isn't evidence. Scar tissue pain is complex, and what helps nerve pain or joint pain may not help pain from adhesions or keloids.\n\n**What I'd tell someone with scar tissue pain:**\n\n1. **Get proper evaluation** - Understand what's causing your specific pain\n2. **Explore proven treatments first** - Physical therapy, massage, steroid injections, and surgery have more evidence\n3. **If considering CBD** - View it as experimental for this specific use\n4. **Consider topical application** - Direct application to scar tissue makes theoretical sense\n5. **Don't abandon conventional care** - CBD shouldn't replace professional treatment\n\nI wish I had better evidence to share. If scar tissue pain research emerges, I'll update this article immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Can CBD help with post-surgical scar pain?\n\nWe don't have research on this specific use. CBD's anti-inflammatory and potential pain-modulating effects provide theoretical rationale, but no studies confirm benefit for post-surgical scar pain.\n\n### Should I use CBD oil topically on scar tissue?\n\nTopical application hasn't been studied for scar tissue pain specifically. If you try it, start with a small area to test for reactions. CBD is generally well-tolerated topically, but this use is experimental.\n\n### Can CBD help with adhesions?\n\nAdhesions are internal scar tissue that can cause significant pain. No research examines CBD for adhesion-related pain. Adhesions often require medical intervention such as physical therapy or surgery.\n\n### Does CBD help keloid scars?\n\nKeloids are overgrown scars that can be painful and itchy. While CBD has anti-inflammatory properties, no studies have examined its effects on keloids specifically. Keloid treatment typically involves medical approaches.\n\n### How much CBD should I use for scar tissue pain?\n\nThere's no established dosing for this condition. General chronic pain research has used various doses (5-50mg daily orally, varying concentrations topically). Any use for scar tissue pain would be experimental.\n\n---\n\n## Related Conditions With Research\n\nFor conditions with more evidence:\n\n- [CBD and Chronic Pain](/knowledge/cbd-and-chronic-pain) - Broader pain research\n- [CBD and Neuropathic Pain](/knowledge/cbd-and-neuropathic-pain) - Nerve pain specifically\n- [CBD and Inflammation](/knowledge/cbd-and-inflammation) - Anti-inflammatory effects\n- [CBD and Arthritis](/knowledge/cbd-and-arthritis) - Joint pain and inflammation\n\n---\n\n## References\n\nNo scar tissue pain-specific CBD studies exist.\n\nRelated research areas:\n\n- [CBD Portal Pain Research Database](/research?topic=pain)\n- [CBD Portal Inflammation Research](/research?topic=inflammation)\n- [CBD Portal Skin Research](/research?topic=skin)\n\n---\n\n## Author\n\n**Robin Roy Krigslund-Hansen** has worked in the CBD industry for over 12 years, including founding Formula Swiss.

 {"id":"41402947-5207-449e-9470-f572281c5637","slug":"hemp-carbon-footprint","title":"Hemp Carbon Footprint: Lifecycle Environmental Analysis","content":"By Robin Roy Krigslund-Hansen | 12+ years in [CBD](/glossary/cannabidiol) industry\nLast updated: January 2026\n\n---\n\nUnderstanding hemp's carbon footprint requires looking at the entire lifecycle—from seed to disposal. While hemp captures carbon during growth, cultivation and processing add emissions. Here's a balanced analysis of hemp's climate impact.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Hemp captures 8-15 tonnes CO2/hectare during growth\n- Net carbon impact depends on processing method and product application\n- Hemp building materials can be carbon-negative (net storage)\n- Processing accounts for most of hemp's carbon emissions\n- Hemp generally outperforms conventional alternatives\n\n## Key Numbers: Hemp Carbon Footprint Analysis\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| CO2 captured during growth | 8-15 tonnes per hectare |\n| Net cultivation impact | -6,500 to -13,500 kg CO2 per hectare |\n| Hemp vs cotton fabric footprint | 50% lower carbon emissions |\n| Hempcrete vs concrete impact | -35 to -50 kg CO2e vs +50 to +100 kg CO2e per m² |\n| Total cultivation emissions | 500-1,500 kg CO2 per hectare |\n\nThese figures demonstrate hemp's strong carbon-negative cultivation phase, though processing methods significantly affect the final product footprint.\n\n## Lifecycle Analysis Framework\n\nCarbon footprint assessment includes all stages:\n\n| Stage | Carbon Impact |\n|-------|--------------|\n| Cultivation | Negative (absorbs CO2) |\n| Harvesting | Positive (fuel, equipment) |\n| Processing | Positive (energy use) |\n| Transport | Positive (logistics) |\n| Product use | Neutral or storage |\n| End-of-life | Variable (compost vs landfill) |\n\n## Cultivation Phase\n\n### Carbon Capture\n\nDuring growth, hemp actively removes CO2 from the atmosphere:\n\n- **Absorption rate:** 8-15 tonnes CO2/ha\n- **Growth period:** 90-120 days\n- **Mechanism:** Photosynthesis converts CO2 to plant matter\n\n### Cultivation Emissions\n\nFarming activities add emissions:\n\n| Activity | CO2e per hectare |\n|----------|-----------------|\n| Seed production | 50-100 kg |\n| Soil preparation | 100-200 kg |\n| Planting | 20-50 kg |\n| Irrigation (if used) | 100-500 kg |\n| Fertilisation | 200-600 kg |\n| Harvest | 100-200 kg |\n| **Total cultivation** | **500-1,500 kg** |\n\n### Net Cultivation Impact\n\nEven accounting for farming emissions, cultivation is strongly carbon-negative:\n\n**Calculation:**\n- CO2 captured: 8,000-15,000 kg\n- Cultivation emissions: 500-1,500 kg\n- **Net: -6,500 to -13,500 kg CO2/ha**\n\n## Processing Phase\n\nProcessing can significantly impact total footprint.\n\n### CBD Extraction\n\n| Method | [Energy](/conditions/energy) Use | CO2e Impact |\n|--------|------------|-------------|\n| CO2 extraction | High | 200-500 kg/tonne biomass |\n| Ethanol extraction | Medium | 150-400 kg/tonne |\n| Cold pressing | Low | 50-100 kg/tonne |\n\n### Fibre Processing\n\n| Process | CO2e per tonne fibre |\n|---------|---------------------|\n| Retting | 100-300 kg |\n| Decortication | 200-500 kg |\n| Textile finishing | 500-2,000 kg |\n| **Total** | **800-2,800 kg** |\n\n### Hempcrete Production\n\n| Component | CO2e per tonne |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| Hemp hurd | Negative (stored carbon) |\n| Lime binder | 500-800 kg |\n| Mixing/application | 50-100 kg |\n| **Net** | **Variable—often negative** |\n\n## Product Carbon Comparison\n\n### Hemp Textile vs Cotton\n\n| Factor | Hemp | Cotton |\n|--------|------|--------|\n| Cultivation CO2 | -8,000 kg/ha | -2,000 kg/ha |\n| Water footprint | Low | Very high |\n| Processing | Medium | Medium-high |\n| Pesticide impact | Minimal | High |\n| **Net per kg fabric** | 3-5 kg CO2e | 8-12 kg CO2e |\n\nHemp fabric has roughly 50% lower carbon footprint than cotton.\n\n### Hempcrete vs Concrete\n\n| Factor | Hempcrete | Concrete |\n|--------|-----------|----------|\n| Material production | Carbon-negative | High emissions |\n| Construction | Similar | Similar |\n| Insulation | Built-in | Required |\n| End-of-life | Compostable | Landfill/recycle |\n| **Net per m²** | -35 to -50 kg CO2e | +50 to +100 kg CO2e |\n\nHempcrete can achieve net-negative carbon over its lifecycle.\n\n### CBD Products\n\nCarbon footprint of CBD products varies:\n\n| Product | CO2e per unit |\n|---------|--------------|\n| CBD oil (30ml) | 0.5-2 kg |\n| CBD capsules (60ct) | 0.3-1 kg |\n| CBD topical (50ml) | 0.5-1.5 kg |\n\nPackaging often contributes significantly to total impact.\n\n## Factors Affecting Footprint\n\n### Positive Influences\n\nPractices that reduce carbon footprint:\n- Organic cultivation (no synthetic fertiliser)\n- Renewable energy in processing\n- Local supply chains\n- Efficient extraction methods\n- Minimal packaging\n\n### Negative Influences\n\nPractices that increase footprint:\n- Long-distance transport\n- Energy-intensive processing\n- Excessive packaging\n- Inefficient cultivation\n\n## Carbon Storage in Products\n\nHemp carbon can be stored long-term in durable products:\n\n| Product | Storage Duration | Carbon Stored |\n|---------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Hempcrete building | 50-100+ years | 50-100 kg/m³ |\n| Hemp insulation | 30-50 years | 30-50 kg/m³ |\n| Durable textiles | 10-30 years | 2-3 kg/kg |\n| Biochar | 100+ years | 800+ kg/tonne |\n\nBuildings made with hempcrete become long-term carbon sinks.\n\n## Improving Hemp's Carbon Footprint\n\n### For Farmers\n\n- Use organic practices\n- Minimise tillage\n- Apply compost instead of synthetic fertiliser\n- Optimise harvest timing\n- Consider cover crops\n\n### For Processors\n\n- Source renewable energy\n- Recover and recycle solvents\n- Minimise water use\n- Use efficient equipment\n- Reduce waste\n\n### For Brands\n\n- Source locally where possible\n- Choose sustainable packaging\n- Support verified low-carbon suppliers\n- Communicate honestly about impacts\n\n\n## My Take\n\nAfter over a decade in this industry, I've seen hemp's environmental story evolve from marketing hype to nuanced reality. Early on, companies would claim hemp was automatically \"carbon neutral\" simply because it's a plant—but that ignores the energy-intensive extraction and processing stages I've witnessed firsthand.\n\nWhat really matters is how hemp products are made and used. I've toured facilities using CO2 extraction versus solvent-based methods, and the energy differences are substantial. The most impressive carbon profiles I've seen come from companies using renewable energy and focusing on long-term storage applications like hempcrete building materials.\n\nThe biggest misconception I encounter is that all hemp products are equally sustainable. A heavily processed CBD isolate shipped internationally has a vastly different footprint than locally-grown hemp fiber. When evaluating products, I always ask manufacturers about their energy sources and processing methods—these details reveal the true environmental impact beyond the marketing claims.\n\n---\n\n## Related Studies\n\nResearch related to this topic:\n\n- [Unveiling [Neurological](/conditions/neurological) Benefits: A Review of Hemp Leaf, Flower, Seed Oil Extract...

The total product lifecycle can be carbon-negative (hempcrete) or carbon-positive (highly processed products), depending on processing and application.\n\n### How does hemp compare to tree planting?\n\nHemp captures more CO2 per hectare per year than most forests. However, forests provide permanent storage, while hemp's carbon fate depends on product use. Both are valuable.\n\n### Does organic hemp have a better carbon footprint?\n\nGenerally yes. Organic hemp avoids synthetic fertilisers (which are energy-intensive to produce) and typically uses lower-impact farming practices.\n\n### What's the carbon footprint of CBD oil?\n\nApproximately 0.5-2 kg CO2e per 30ml bottle, depending on cultivation, extraction method, packaging, and transport. Premium brands with sustainable practices tend toward the lower end.\n\n### How can I choose lower-carbon hemp products?\n\nLook for: organic certification, local sourcing, minimal packaging, transparent supply chains, and brands that disclose environmental impacts.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHemp's carbon footprint is generally favourable compared to conventional alternatives. While processing adds emissions, cultivation captures significantly more carbon than farming releases.\n\nThe most impactful applications—hempcrete, biochar, durable products—store carbon long-term, making hemp a genuine climate solution. For CBD products, choosing sustainably-produced options minimises impact.\n\n**Next steps:**\n- Explore [sustainable hemp cultivation](/articles/sustainable-hemp-cultivation)\n- Learn about [hemp and the environment](/articles/hemp-and-environment)\n- Understand [hemp sustainability benefits](/articles/hemp-sustainability-benefits)\n\n---\n\n*Last Updated: January 2026*\n\n**Disclaimer:** Carbon calculations are estimates based on available data.

Based on the 25 studies I've reviewed, the answer is nuanced. While [THC](/glossary/thc) has been shown to lower [intraocular pressure](/glossary/intraocular-pressure) (IOP), CBD's effects are more complex. Some research suggests CBD may actually increase IOP or interfere with THC's pressure lowering effects. The [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) does play a role in eye function, but CBD specifically may not be beneficial for [glaucoma](/conditions/glaucoma). This is an area where the evidence goes against popular assumptions.\n\n---\n\n## Research Snapshot\n\n| | |\n|---|---|\n| **Studies reviewed** | 25 |\n| **Human studies** | 25 |\n| **Clinical trials** | Multiple controlled studies |\n| **Key finding** | CBD may increase IOP |\n| **Typical context** | Glaucoma, ocular pressure |\n| **Evidence strength** | ●●○○○ Limited (with caution) |\n\n---\n\n## Key Numbers\n\n| Stat | Finding |\n|------|---------|\n| **25** | Total eye health studies reviewed |\n| **25** | Human and clinical studies |\n| **5** | Studies published 2023 to 2026 |\n| **1984 to 2026** | Over 40 years of research |\n| **Important** | CBD and THC have different effects |\n\n---\n\n## What the Research Shows\n\n### The Best Evidence (Clinical Trials)\n\nEye health research with cannabinoids has revealed that different cannabinoids have different, sometimes opposite, effects on the eye.\n\nA 2025 study examined the effect of dronabinol (synthetic THC) on ocular hemodynamics, finding effects on blood flow in the eye. This addresses vascular aspects of glaucoma.\n\nA 2018 study specifically compared THC and CBD effects on intraocular pressure, finding they work differently. THC lowered pressure while CBD did not, and CBD may even interfere with THC's beneficial effects.\n\nA 2006 pilot study examined [sublingual](/glossary/sublingual) cannabinoid application effects on intraocular pressure, providing early evidence on how different cannabinoids affect IOP.\n\nResearch from 2022 examined CBD's effects on aqueous humor outflow and trabecular meshwork cell signaling, the specific mechanisms that regulate eye pressure.\n\n### What Reviews Conclude\n\nThe scientific literature reveals an important distinction: while cannabis has historically been associated with lowering eye pressure, this effect appears primarily due to THC, not CBD.\n\nA 2019 review specifically addressed what is currently known about CBD and ocular pressure, concluding that CBD's effects are different from and potentially antagonistic to THC's beneficial effects on IOP.\n\nReviews note that the [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) is present throughout the eye, including in the structures that regulate intraocular pressure. However, CBD's interactions with this system don't appear to lower pressure as THC does.\n\nThe literature emphasizes that patients using CBD for glaucoma based on cannabis's reputation may not be getting the pressure lowering benefits they expect, and could potentially be harming their eye health.\n\n### Supporting Evidence\n\nOcular blood flow research shows cannabinoids affect [circulation](/conditions/circulation) in the eye. A 2025 single oral dose study of dronabinol increased ocular blood flow in glaucoma patients, which could be [neuroprotective](/glossary/neuroprotective).\n\nResearch on the [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) in the eye has expanded understanding of how cannabinoids might affect various eye conditions beyond just pressure.\n\nNeuroprotection studies examine whether cannabinoids might protect the optic nerve independently of pressure effects, relevant because glaucoma damages the optic nerve.\n\n---\n\n\nRelevant research includes:\n- [The Effect of Dronabinol on Ocular Hemodynamics in... (2025)](/research/study/cbd-[arthritis](/conditions/arthritis)-research-2025-4)\n\n## Studies Worth Knowing\n\n### THC vs CBD Comparison (2018)\n\nDirect comparison of how THC and CBD affect intraocular pressure differently.\n\n**Key finding:** THC lowered IOP while CBD did not have this effect and may counteract THC's pressure lowering effects.\n\n**Sample:** Controlled comparison | **Type:** Mechanistic Study\n\n**Why it matters:** This directly challenges the assumption that CBD helps glaucoma. Patients need to understand that CBD and THC have different, potentially opposite effects on eye pressure.\n\n---\n\n### Ocular Blood Flow Study (2025)\n\nResearch on synthetic THC (dronabinol) effects on eye circulation.\n\n**Key finding:** Oral dronabinol increased blood flow in the eyes of glaucoma patients.\n\n**Sample:** Glaucoma patients | **Type:** Clinical Study\n\n**Why it matters:** Glaucoma involves both pressure and blood flow issues. Understanding how cannabinoids affect ocular circulation helps evaluate their potential role in treatment.\n\n---\n\n### CBD and Ocular Pressure Review (2019)\n\nReview of current knowledge about CBD specifically and eye pressure.\n\n**Key finding:** Concluded that CBD does not lower IOP and may even raise it, contrary to popular belief about cannabis and glaucoma.\n\n**Sample:** Literature review | **Type:** Review\n\n**Why it matters:** This authoritative review corrects misconceptions and warns against assuming CBD helps glaucoma.\n\n---\n\n### Sublingual Cannabinoid Study (2006)\n\n\n> For more information, see our guide on [CBD and Liver Health: What Research Shows About Liver Enzymes](/articles/cbd-and-liver-health).\nEarly clinical research on sublingual cannabinoid effects on eye pressure.\n\n**Key finding:** Examined how different cannabinoid preparations affect IOP when delivered sublingually.\n\n**Sample:** Pilot study participants | **Type:** Pilot Study\n\n**Why it matters:** Provided early evidence distinguishing between different cannabinoids' effects on the eye.\n\n---\n\n## How Cannabinoids Affect the Eye\n\n\n> For more information, see our guide on [CBD and Womens Health: What the Research Shows 2026](/articles/cbd-and-womens-health).\nThe relationship between cannabinoids and eye health involves complex mechanisms that differ between CBD and THC.\n\n\n> For more information, see our guide on [CBD and Neurological Health: What the Research Shows 2026](/articles/cbd-and-neurological-health).\nThe [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) in the eye includes [CB1 receptor](/glossary/cb1-receptor)s in the ciliary body (which produces aqueous humor) and trabecular meshwork (which drains it). This system helps regulate intraocular pressure.\n\n\n> For more information, see our guide on [CBD and Glaucoma & Eye Pressure: What the Research Shows](/articles/cbd-and-glaucoma).\nTHC lowers eye pressure through [CB1 receptor](/glossary/cb1-receptor) activation, increasing aqueous humor outflow. This is the basis for historical interest in cannabis for glaucoma.\n\n\n> For more information, see our guide on [CBD for Eye Health: What We Know](/articles/cbd-for-eye-health).\nCBD's effects are different and potentially problematic for glaucoma. Research suggests CBD may:\n- Not lower IOP significantly\n- Potentially increase IOP\n- Interfere with THC's pressure lowering effects when used together\n\nThe mechanism behind CBD's different effects is being studied. CBD doesn't directly activate [CB1 receptor](/glossary/cb1-receptor) and may modulate them in ways that oppose THC's beneficial effects on eye pressure.\n\nNeuroprotection through cannabinoids might still benefit glaucoma independently of pressure effects. Glaucoma damages the optic nerve, and cannabinoids' [neuroprotective](/glossary/neuroprotective) properties could theoretically help, though this needs more research.\n\n---\n\n## What This Means for Eye Health\n\nI want to be clear: this is one area where I need to present concerning rather than encouraging evidence.\n\n**For glaucoma patients:**\n- CBD alone likely does not lower eye pressure\n- CBD may actually increase IOP\n- CBD may interfere with THC's pressure lowering effects\n- Don't substitute CBD for glaucoma treatment\n\n**For general eye health:**\n- The [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) plays a role in eye function\n- Research continues on cannabinoids for various eye conditions\n- CBD's effects on eye health beyond pressure need more research\n\n**Important considerations:**\n- Glaucoma is a serious condition causing irreversible vision loss\n- Eye pressure must be managed with proven treatments\n- Relying on CBD for glaucoma could result in vision damage\n- Discuss any cannabinoid use with your ophthalmologist\n\nUse our [dosage calculator](/tools/dosage-calculator) for general CBD guidance, but do not use CBD as a glaucoma treatment.\n\n---\n\n## My Take\n\nHaving reviewed 25 studies on CBD and eye health, and worked in the CBD industry for over a decade, here's my honest assessment:\n\nThis is one area where I need to be clear that CBD may not help and could potentially harm. The popular belief that \"cannabis helps glaucoma\" comes from THC's effects, not CBD's. The research suggests CBD doesn't lower eye pressure and might actually raise it.\n\nI take this seriously because glaucoma causes irreversible vision loss. Someone managing their glaucoma with CBD instead of appropriate treatment could go blind. That's not an exaggeration. Glaucoma progresses silently, and by the time you notice vision loss, permanent damage has occurred.\n\nThe endocannabinoid research in the eye is fascinating from a scientific perspective. There's genuine interest in how this system regulates eye function. But current evidence doesn't support using CBD for glaucoma.\n\nMy practical advice: if you have glaucoma, do not rely on CBD for treatment. Continue your prescribed medications and follow your ophthalmologist's recommendations. If you're interested in cannabinoid approaches, discuss THC based options with your eye doctor, understanding that even these aren't first line treatments. For general eye health without glaucoma, there's no strong reason to use CBD specifically.\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Does CBD help glaucoma?\n\nBased on current evidence, CBD does not appear to help glaucoma and may actually be harmful. Research shows CBD does not lower intraocular pressure like THC does, and some studies suggest CBD may increase eye pressure. Do not use CBD as a glaucoma treatment.\n\n### Doesn't cannabis lower eye pressure?\n\nTHC, the psychoactive component of cannabis, can lower intraocular pressure temporarily. However, CBD appears to have different effects and may not lower pressure or could even raise it. The beneficial effects attributed to \"cannabis\" for glaucoma are primarily from THC.\n\n### Can I use CBD with my glaucoma medication?\n\nDiscuss any CBD use with your ophthalmologist. Given that CBD may increase eye pressure, it could potentially interfere with your glaucoma treatment. Do not add CBD to your regimen without medical guidance.\n\n### Is CBD safe for eye health in general?\n\nFor people without glaucoma or elevated eye pressure, there's no specific evidence that CBD harms the eyes. However, there's also no strong evidence it benefits eye health. The concern is specifically for people who need to manage their eye pressure.\n\n### What about CBD eye drops?\n\nResearch on topical CBD for the eye is limited. The systemic effects discussed in studies use oral or sublingual delivery. Topical CBD eye products haven't been proven safe or effective for any eye condition.\n\n### Should I avoid CBD entirely if I have glaucoma?\n\nDiscuss with your ophthalmologist. Given the concerning evidence that CBD may increase eye pressure, caution is warranted. At minimum, don't use CBD hoping it will help your glaucoma, as evidence suggests otherwise.\n\n---\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Related Conditions\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n- [CBD and [Neurological](/conditions/neurological) health](/knowledge/cbd-and-neurological-health)\n- [CBD and Healthy aging](/knowledge/cbd-and-healthy-aging)\n\n## References\n\nI reviewed 25 studies for this article.

Start lower than you think you need, increase slowly, and pay attention to your body. Most people find their sweet spot somewhere between 25-75mg daily, but this varies widely.\n\nThe goal is minimum effective dose—the smallest amount that gives you the benefits you're looking for. More isn't necessarily better, and starting low helps you find that optimal point without overshooting.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n## Related Studies\n\nResearch related to this topic:\n\n- [High dosage of cannabidiol (CBD) alleviates pentylenetetrazole-induced [epilepsy](/conditions/epilepsy) ...

Always consult your healthcare provider before combining CBD with prescription medications, especially [blood thinners](/conditions/blood-thinners), seizure medications, or heart medications. Your doctor may need to adjust dosages or monitor you more closely.\n\n### How long should I wait between dose increases?\n\nWait at least 5-7 days before increasing your CBD dose. This allows enough time for the compound to build up in your system and for you to accurately assess its effects. Increasing too quickly makes it difficult to identify your optimal dose and may lead to unnecessary side effects.\n\n### Does the time of day I take CBD affect my dosage needs?\n\nTaking CBD in the morning may require different dosing than evening use due to natural circadian rhythms and daily stressors. Many users find they need 20-30% less CBD for sleep when taken 1-2 hours before bedtime compared to daytime anxiety doses, as the body is naturally preparing to rest.\n\n### What should I do if I accidentally take too much CBD?\n\nCBD overdose isn't dangerous, but you may experience drowsiness, [dry mouth](/conditions/dry-mouth), or mild [nausea](/conditions/nausea). Drink plenty of water, rest if possible, and avoid [driving](/conditions/driving) or operating machinery. These effects typically subside within 4-6 hours as CBD metabolizes out of your system.\n\n### Should I split my daily CBD dose or take it all at once?\n\nFor general wellness, taking your full dose once daily is fine. For managing specific symptoms like anxiety or pain throughout the day, splitting into 2-3 smaller doses every 6-8 hours often provides more consistent relief and better symptom management.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n- [How Much CBD Should I Take](/guides/how-much-cbd-should-i-take)\n- [CBD Bioavailability](/knowledge/cbd-bioavailability-guide)\n- [CBD Timing Guide](/knowledge/cbd-timing-guide)\n\n---\n\n*This article is for educational purposes only.

The answer is [bioavailability](/glossary/bioavailability) — and it explains why dosing matters and why different consumption methods feel different.\n\n---\n\n## Research Snapshot\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Studies reviewed | 88 |\n| Human clinical trials | 88 |\n| Total participants | 29+ |\n| Evidence strength | ●●●○○ Moderate |\n\n*Research on CBD and bioavailability continues to evolve. [Browse all studies](/research)*\n\n## Quick Answer\n\n**Bioavailability** is the percentage of a substance that reaches your bloodstream and becomes available to your body. For CBD, this ranges from roughly 6% (oral) to 30%+ (inhaled). A 50mg CBD edible might deliver only 3-6mg to your system, while 50mg inhaled could deliver 15mg or more. Understanding bioavailability helps you dose effectively and choose the right products.\n\n## Key Numbers: CBD Bioavailability Rates\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Oral CBD bioavailability | 6-19% |\n| Sublingual CBD bioavailability | 13-35% |\n| Inhaled CBD bioavailability | 25-35% |\n| Actual CBD from 50mg edible | 3-6mg |\n| Food effect on absorption | Up to 4x higher |\n\nThese bioavailability percentages explain why a 100mg CBD gummy only delivers about 10mg of actual CBD to your bloodstream, while the same dose inhaled could deliver 25-35mg.\n\n## Bioavailability by Method\n\n| Method | Bioavailability | Onset | Duration |\n|--------|-----------------|-------|----------|\n| **Inhalation** | 25-35% | 1-5 min | 2-4 hours |\n| **[Sublingual](/glossary/sublingual)** | 13-35% | 15-30 min | 4-6 hours |\n| **Oral (edibles)** | 6-19% | 30-90 min | 6-8 hours |\n| **Topical** | Low (local) | 15-45 min | 2-4 hours |\n| **Nano/water-soluble** | 20-50%* | 15-30 min | 4-6 hours |\n\n*Nano/water-soluble claims vary; independent testing often shows lower numbers.\n\n## Why Bioavailability Matters\n\n### Effective Dosing\n\nIf oral CBD has ~10% bioavailability:\n- A 100mg CBD gummy delivers ~10mg actual CBD\n- To get 25mg effective CBD, you'd need ~250mg oral\n\n### Cost Effectiveness\n\nUnderstanding bioavailability affects value:\n- A cheaper, higher-dose product might be less effective\n- A more expensive nano formulation might deliver more\n- Method matters as much as milligrams\n\n### Consistency\n\nHigher bioavailability methods tend to be more consistent:\n- Inhalation: Fairly predictable\n- Sublingual: Reasonably consistent\n- Oral: Highly variable (food, metabolism)\n\n## Oral CBD (Edibles, Capsules)\n\n### What Happens\n\nWhen you swallow CBD:\n\n1. CBD travels to stomach\n2. Passes to small intestine\n3. Absorbed into portal vein\n4. Travels to liver\n5. **[First-pass metabolism](/glossary/first-pass-metabolism)** — liver breaks down CBD\n6. Remaining CBD enters bloodstream\n7. Only 6-19% reaches systemic [circulation](/conditions/circulation)\n\n### First-Pass Effect\n\nThe liver metabolises CBD before it can circulate:\n\n- Cytochrome P450 enzymes (especially CYP3A4) process CBD\n- CBD is broken into metabolites\n- Most CBD never reaches your system\n- This is why oral bioavailability is low\n\n### Factors Affecting Oral Bioavailability\n\n**Food matters significantly:**\n- CBD with high-fat food: Up to 4x higher absorption\n- Fasted state: Lower absorption\n- Why: CBD is fat-soluble and needs fats for absorption\n\n**Individual factors:**\n- Metabolism speed\n- [Gut health](/conditions/gut-health)\n- Liver function\n- Genetics (CYP450 variants)\n\n### Practical Implications\n\n- Take CBD capsules/edibles with food (especially fats)\n- Higher doses needed compared to other methods\n- Effects take longer but last longer\n- Variable person-to-person\n\n## Sublingual CBD (Under Tongue)\n\n### What Happens\n\nWhen you hold CBD oil under your tongue:\n\n1. CBD absorbs through sublingual mucosa\n2. Enters capillaries directly\n3. Bypasses first-pass metabolism (partially)\n4. Directly enters systemic circulation\n5. What you swallow undergoes normal digestion\n\n### Bioavailability Range\n\nStudies show 13-35%:\n- Higher than oral\n- Depends on how long you hold it\n- Depends on formulation\n\n### How to Maximise Absorption\n\n- Hold under tongue for 60-90 seconds minimum\n- Don't swallow immediately\n- Avoid eating/drinking for 15 minutes after\n- Use [alcohol](/conditions/alcohol)-based tinctures (may absorb slightly better)\n\n### Practical Implications\n\n- More efficient than swallowing\n- Faster onset (15-30 minutes)\n- More consistent dosing\n- Middle ground between oral and inhalation\n\n## Inhaled CBD (Vaping, Smoking)\n\n### What Happens\n\nWhen you inhale CBD:\n\n1. CBD enters lungs\n2. Absorbs through alveoli (air sacs)\n3. Enters pulmonary circulation directly\n4. Reaches brain in seconds\n5. Completely bypasses first-pass metabolism\n\n### Why Bioavailability is Highest\n\n- Huge surface area in lungs\n- Direct blood contact\n- No liver processing first\n- 25-35% or higher reaches bloodstream\n\n### Considerations\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Highest bioavailability\n- Fastest onset\n- Most predictable dosing\n\n**Concerns:**\n- Lung health implications\n- Vape quality concerns (additives)\n- Social/practical limitations\n- Not suitable for everyone\n\n### Practical Implications\n\n- Lowest dose needed\n- Effects within minutes\n- Good for acute situations (anxiety attacks)\n- Consider lung health\n\n## Topical CBD\n\n### What Happens\n\n\n> For more information, see our guide on [Cannabinoid Tolerance: Why Effects Decrease and How to Reset](/articles/cannabinoid-tolerance).\nWhen you apply CBD to skin:\n\n1. CBD absorbs into skin layers\n2. Acts locally on [CB2](/glossary/cb2-receptor) receptors, TRPV1\n3. Generally doesn't reach bloodstream significantly\n4. Effects are localised\n\n### Not True \"Bioavailability\"\n\nTopicals don't aim for systemic absorption:\n- They work locally\n- Bioavailability to bloodstream is very low\n- That's actually the point — targeted relief\n\n### When Topicals Make Sense\n\n- Joint/muscle [pain](/conditions/pain)\n- Skin conditions\n- Localised [inflammation](/conditions/inflammation)\n- When you don't want systemic effects\n\n### Transdermal Patches\n\nDifferent from topicals:\n- Designed to penetrate to bloodstream\n- Use permeation enhancers\n- Slow, steady release\n- More consistent systemic delivery\n\n## Water-Soluble/Nano CBD\n\n### The Technology\n\nCBD is fat-soluble, but some products use technology to make it mix with water:\n\n**Methods:**\n- Nanoemulsion (tiny droplets)\n- Liposomes (lipid spheres)\n- Microencapsulation\n- Cyclodextrin complexation\n\n### Claims vs Reality\n\n**Marketing claims:**\n- 5-10x better absorption\n- Fast-acting\n- No food required\n- Up to 90% bioavailability\n\n**Reality:**\n- Some improvement over standard oral\n- Independent studies show more modest gains\n- 20-50% may be realistic for good formulations\n- Not all \"nano\" products are created equal\n\n### When They Make Sense\n\n- You prefer oral consumption\n- Want more consistent dosing\n- Don't want to depend on food\n- Willing to pay premium\n\n### Scepticism Advised\n\n- Request third-party bioavailability studies\n- \"Nano\" doesn't guarantee better absorption\n- Some products are marketing gimmicks\n- Good formulation matters\n\n## Calculating Effective Doses\n\n### Example Calculations\n\n**Scenario: You want ~25mg CBD effect**\n\n| Method | Bioavailability | Dose Needed |\n|--------|-----------------|-------------|\n| Oral (no food) | 6% | ~400mg |\n| Oral (with fat) | 15% | ~170mg |\n| Sublingual | 25% | ~100mg |\n| Inhaled | 35% | ~70mg |\n\nThese are estimates — individual variation is significant.\n\n### Why This Matters for Comparison\n\nComparing products by mg/dollar isn't enough:\n- 100mg in a gummy ≠ 100mg in a vape\n- Method affects actual delivery\n- Calculate cost per \"effective mg\" for true comparison\n\n## Factors Affecting Individual Bioavailability\n\n### Genetic Factors\n\n**CYP450 enzymes:**\n- \"Fast metabolisers\" break down CBD quickly\n- \"Slow metabolisers\" process it more slowly\n- This affects how much CBD reaches your system\n\n### Body Composition\n\n- Higher body fat may affect distribution\n- Lean individuals may need less\n- Weight affects dosing to some degree\n\n### Gut Health\n\nFor oral CBD:\n- Gut inflammation may affect absorption\n- Healthy gut microbiome may help\n- Conditions affecting gut can reduce bioavailability\n\n### Tolerance\n\n- Regular users may need higher doses\n- But this isn't about bioavailability — it's receptor response\n- Taking breaks can restore sensitivity\n\n## Practical Recommendations\n\n### For General Use\n\nSublingual is the best balance:\n- Reasonable bioavailability\n- Easy to use\n- Fast enough onset\n- No lung concerns\n\n### For Acute Situations\n\nInhalation works fastest:\n- [Anxiety](/conditions/anxiety) attacks\n- Sudden pain\n- When you need quick relief\n\n### For Sustained Effects\n\nOral/edible works longest:\n- [Sleep](/conditions/sleep) support\n- All-day coverage\n- When timing isn't critical\n\n### For Local Issues\n\nTopicals are most targeted:\n- Muscle pain\n- Joint issues\n- Skin conditions\n\n\n## My Take\n\nAfter 12+ years in this industry and testing hundreds of products, I've seen countless people frustrated with CBD because they don't understand bioavailability. They'll take a 25mg gummy, feel nothing, then assume CBD \"doesn't work for them\" — not realizing only 2-3mg actually reached their system.\n\nHere's what I wish everyone knew: bioavailability isn't just about numbers on a chart. It's highly individual. I've seen people respond beautifully to low-bioavailability edibles due to their metabolism, while others need high-bioavailability methods like sublingual oils to feel any effect. The key is understanding that a 50mg label doesn't mean 50mg of active CBD in your bloodstream.\n\nMy advice? Start with sublingual oils for consistency, then experiment. Track your doses and effects in a journal. Don't chase higher milligrams — chase better absorption. It's more cost-effective and gives you better control over your experience.\n\n---\n\n## Related Studies\n\nResearch related to this topic:\n\n- [Novel Lipid Formulation Increases Absorption of Oral Cannabidiol (CBD) (2024)](/research/study/novel-lipid-formulation-increases-absorption-of-oral-cannabi-2024-b893a8) - Human Trial\n- [Oral bioavailability of the novel cannabinoid CB1 antagonist AM6527: Effects on ...

Standard oil-filled capsules don't release under the tongue — you'd need to break them open. Sublingual oils are designed for this purpose.\n\n### Are higher-bioavailability methods always better?\n\nNot necessarily. Oral CBD's slower onset and longer duration may be better for some uses (like sleep). Choose method based on your needs, not just bioavailability.\n\n### How accurate are the bioavailability numbers?\n\nThey're estimates with wide ranges. Individual variation is huge. Use them as guidelines, not exact figures.\n\n### Does CBD potency degrade over time?\n\nYes. Stored improperly, CBD can degrade, reducing effective dose. This isn't bioavailability but does affect how much active CBD you receive.\n\n## Sources\n\n1. Millar SA, et al. (2018).

CBD has low oral [bioavailability](/glossary/bioavailability) (6-19%), is highly lipophilic, gets metabolized by liver enzymes (primarily CYP3A4 and CYP2C19), and has a [half-life](/glossary/half-life) of 18-32 hours. Understanding pharmacokinetics helps explain why delivery method, timing, and food intake all affect CBD's effects.\n\n---\n\n## The Four Phases\n\n### 1. Absorption\nHow CBD enters your bloodstream:\n\n| Method | Bioavailability | Onset |\n|--------|-----------------|-------|\n| Inhalation (vape) | 31-34% | Minutes |\n| [Sublingual](/glossary/sublingual) | 13-35% | 15-45 min |\n| Oral (swallowed) | 6-19% | 1-2 hours |\n| Topical | Local only | Minutes |\n\n**Key factor:** CBD is lipophilic (fat-loving), so taking it with fatty foods dramatically increases absorption—up to 4-5 times higher bioavailability.\n\n### 2. Distribution\nWhere CBD goes in your body:\n\n- Highly fat-soluble, so it accumulates in fatty tissues\n- Crosses the blood-brain barrier\n- Distributes throughout organs and tissues\n- Can remain stored in fat for extended periods\n- Volume of distribution is high (~32 L/kg)\n\n### 3. Metabolism\nHow CBD is broken down:\n\n**Primary pathway:** Liver metabolism via cytochrome P450 enzymes\n- **CYP3A4** - Major enzyme for CBD metabolism\n- **CYP2C19** - Secondary pathway\n- **CYP2C9** - Minor contribution\n\n**Metabolites:**\n- 7-OH-CBD (7-hydroxy-CBD) - primary metabolite\n- 7-COOH-CBD (7-carboxy-CBD)\n- Various hydroxylated and carboxylated derivatives\n\n**First-pass effect:** When swallowed, CBD passes through the liver before reaching [circulation](/conditions/circulation), significantly reducing available CBD.\n\n### 4. Elimination\nHow CBD leaves your body:\n\n- **Half-life:** 18-32 hours (can vary widely)\n- **Primary route:** Feces (via bile)\n- **Secondary route:** Urine\n- **Steady state:** Reached after ~1 week of daily use\n- **Complete elimination:** May take several weeks after stopping\n\n---\n\n## Why Bioavailability Matters\n\nLow bioavailability means most CBD you take doesn't reach your bloodstream:\n\n**Example with 30mg oral dose:**\n- At 10% bioavailability: Only 3mg reaches circulation\n- At 6% bioavailability: Only 1.8mg reaches circulation\n\nThis explains why:\n- Oral doses need to be higher than sublingual\n- Food significantly affects results\n- Some people need much higher doses than others\n- Delivery method matters as much as total mg\n\n---\n\n## First-Pass Metabolism\n\nWhen you swallow CBD:\n\n1. CBD enters stomach and intestines\n2. Absorbed into portal vein\n3. Goes directly to liver\n4. Liver metabolizes significant portion\n5. Remaining CBD enters systemic circulation\n\n**Sublingual delivery** partially bypasses this by absorbing through mouth mucosa directly into bloodstream.\n\n---\n\n## Food and Absorption\n\nTaking CBD with food, especially fatty food:\n\n| Factor | Without Food | With High-Fat Meal |\n|--------|--------------|-------------------|\n| Bioavailability | ~6% | ~24% |\n| Peak levels | Lower | 4-5x higher |\n| Time to peak | 1-2 hours | 2-4 hours |\n\n**Practical advice:** Take CBD with a meal containing some fat (avocado, nuts, olive oil, cheese, etc.) for better absorption.\n\n---\n\n## Time Course of Effects\n\n**Single dose:**\n- Onset: 30min - 2 hours (oral)\n- Peak levels: 1-4 hours\n- Duration: 4-12 hours (varies)\n\n**Daily dosing:**\n- Steady state: ~1 week\n- Accumulation in fatty tissues\n- More consistent effects over time\n- May need lower doses once stable\n\n---\n\n## Individual Variation\n\nMany factors affect your CBD pharmacokinetics:\n\n**Genetic:**\n- CYP enzyme variants\n- Cannabinoid receptor polymorphisms\n- Body composition\n\n**Physiological:**\n- Age\n- Weight\n- Body fat percentage\n- Liver function\n- Recent food intake\n\n**Other:**\n- Concurrent medications\n- Other supplements\n- Regular vs occasional use\n\n---\n\n## Drug Interactions\n\nCBD inhibits CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 enzymes, potentially affecting medications:\n\n- Certain seizure medications\n- [Blood thinners](/conditions/blood-thinners) (warfarin)\n- Some statins\n- Certain immunosuppressants\n- Various psychiatric medications\n\n**Important:** Consult healthcare providers about potential interactions with any medications.\n\n---\n\n## Half-Life Implications\n\nCBD's 18-32 hour half-life means:\n\n- Once daily dosing is often sufficient\n- Takes ~1 week to reach steady state\n- Stays in system for weeks after stopping\n- May accumulate with frequent use\n- Effects may build over time\n\n---\n\n## Research Limitations\n\nCurrent pharmacokinetic knowledge has gaps:\n\n- Most studies use pure CBD, not [full-spectrum](/glossary/full-spectrum) products\n- [Terpene](/glossary/terpenes)/cannabinoid interactions may affect kinetics\n- Long-term accumulation effects not fully understood\n- Individual variation not well characterized\n- Optimal dosing strategies still unclear\n\n---\n\n## Practical Takeaways\n\n1. **Take with fatty food** for best absorption\n2. **Be patient** - effects may build over days/weeks\n3. **Consistency matters** - regular dosing establishes steady levels\n4. **Timing flexibility** - long half-life allows flexible dosing\n5. **Start low** - due to accumulation, start conservative\n\n---\n\n## My Take\n\nUnderstanding pharmacokinetics transformed how I think about CBD dosing. The low bioavailability of oral CBD explains why people often need higher doses than they expect. The importance of fat in absorption explains why taking CBD on an empty stomach often disappoints. And the long half-life explains why consistent daily use tends to work better than occasional use.\n\nThis isn't just academic knowledge—it's practical information that can make the difference between CBD working for you or concluding it doesn't work at all.\n\n---\n\n## Related Topics\n\n- [CBD Bioavailability](/knowledge/cbd-bioavailability)\n- [CBD Drug Interactions](/knowledge/cbd-drug-interactions)\n- [CBD Dosage Guide](/knowledge/cbd-dosage-guide)\n- [How CBD Works](/knowledge/how-cbd-works)\n\n---\n\n*This article is for educational purposes only.*\n\n\n---\n\n## Related Studies\n\nResearch related to this topic:\n\n- [Cannabidiol potentiates Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) behavioural effects and al...

(2023)](/research/study/assessment-of-orally-administered-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-whe-2023-17cff2) - Human Trial\n\n[Browse all CBD research →](/research)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Does CBD show up on drug tests?\n\nStandard drug tests don't screen for CBD itself, but full-spectrum CBD products contain trace amounts of THC (up to 0.3%) that could potentially accumulate and trigger a positive result with heavy use. CBD isolate products are THC-free and shouldn't cause positive tests, but choose third-party tested products to ensure purity.\n\n### How long does CBD stay in your system after stopping?\n\nCBD can be detected in blood for 2-5 days, urine for 3-15 days, and potentially longer in heavy users due to accumulation in fat tissue. Since CBD has an 18-32 hour half-life, it takes about 5-7 half-lives for complete elimination, meaning roughly 4-9 days for occasional users.\n\n### Why does CBD work better on an empty stomach for some people but with food for others?\n\nWhile fatty foods increase CBD absorption by 4-5 times, some people experience faster onset on an empty stomach despite lower overall absorption. This happens because food delays gastric emptying, so you absorb more CBD but feel effects later. The trade-off is between speed versus intensity of effects.\n\n### Can taking CBD daily cause it to build up in my body?\n\nCBD does accumulate in fatty tissues with daily use, which can lead to steady-state levels after 1-2 weeks of consistent dosing. This accumulation may enhance therapeutic effects over time but also means it takes longer to clear from your system when you stop taking it.\n\n### Does the time of day I take CBD affect how my body processes it?\n\nYour liver's enzyme activity follows circadian rhythms, potentially affecting CBD metabolism rates throughout the day. Additionally, taking CBD with your largest meal (typically dinner) maximizes absorption due to increased fat content, while morning doses on an empty stomach may provide faster but weaker effects.\n\n---\n\n**Medical Disclaimer:** This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

Products must be registered with DIGEMID (Peru's drug regulatory agency) and often require a medical prescription or pharmacist consultation. Availability varies by location, with Lima and major cities having better selection than rural areas.\n\n### How much does medical CBD cost in Peru?\n\nMedical CBD products in Peru typically cost between 200-800 soles ($55-220 USD) for a 30ml bottle, depending on concentration and brand. Prescription CBD through the medical system may be partially subsidized, while over-the-counter products at pharmacies are generally more expensive. Prices have been decreasing as local production increases.\n\n### Do I need a doctor's prescription to buy CBD in Peru?\n\nMost therapeutic CBD products require either a prescription from a licensed physician or consultation with a registered pharmacist. Lower-concentration wellness products (under 1% THC) may be available without prescription at some pharmacies. The requirements vary by product strength and intended use, with higher concentrations always requiring medical oversight.\n\n### Can I bring my CBD medication from another country into Peru?\n\nBringing CBD products into Peru requires prior authorization from DIGEMID and proper medical documentation, including original prescriptions and product certificates of analysis. The process can take 2-4 weeks and isn't guaranteed approval. It's generally easier and more reliable to obtain CBD through Peru's established pharmacy system upon arrival.\n\n### What's the difference between CBD sold in pharmacies versus other stores in Peru?\n\nPharmacy CBD products must meet DIGEMID quality standards, undergo testing for potency and contaminants, and provide accurate labeling. Products sold outside pharmacies may be unregulated dietary supplements with questionable quality and potency. For safety and efficacy, medical professionals recommend purchasing only from licensed pharmacies or authorized medical dispensaries.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n- [CBD Laws in South America](/knowledge/cbd-laws-south-america)\n- [Traveling with CBD](/guides/traveling-with-cbd)\n\n---\n\n*This article is for informational purposes only.*\n","excerpt":"CBD is legal in Peru for medical use with pharmacy access.

Flower?](/articles/cbd-flower-guide)\n\n\n## My Take\n\nAfter testing dozens of CBD hash products over the past decade, I've learned that quality varies dramatically in this category. The best CBD hash I've encountered has a distinct aromatic profile—you should smell the terpenes immediately upon opening the package. Poor-quality hash often smells flat or overly earthy, indicating inferior starting material or processing.\n\nWhen evaluating CBD hash, I always check the texture first. Quality hash should be pliable when warmed between your fingers but firm at room temperature. If it crumbles to dust or feels overly sticky, it's likely poorly made. I also look for lab reports showing not just CBD content, but the full cannabinoid and terpene profile—this tells me whether they used quality flower or trim.\n\nThe biggest mistake I see consumers make is assuming all hash is created equal. Many products labeled as \"CBD hash\" are actually just compressed kief or low-grade material. True hash requires proper resin extraction techniques.\n\nCBD hash works best for experienced users who want potent, fast-acting effects. It's not ideal for [beginners](/conditions/beginners) due to its concentrated nature and the learning curve around proper dosing and consumption methods.\n\n---\n\n## Related Studies\n\nResearch related to this topic:\n\n- [(2015). \"The Dabbing Dilemma: A Call for Research on Butane Hash Oil and Other A...

However, some states have restrictions on hemp concentrates. Always verify local laws and purchase from reputable sources with lab testing.\n\n### How strong is CBD hash compared to CBD flower?\nCBD hash is typically 2-4 times more concentrated than CBD flower. While flower usually contains 10-25% CBD, hash can contain 30-60% or more. This means you need less hash to achieve similar effects compared to flower.\n\n### How do I know if CBD hash is good quality?\nQuality CBD hash should have a strong, pleasant aroma (not chemical or musty), consistent color and texture, and verified lab testing. Higher grades produce less residue when heated. Ask for a Certificate of Analysis showing cannabinoid content and purity.\n\n### Can I eat CBD hash directly?\nRaw CBD hash won't be very effective because the cannabinoids aren't activated. For oral use, you need to decarboxylate (heat) the hash first to convert CBDa to CBD. It's easier to use pre-decarbed products or vaporize/smoke hash for immediate effects.\n\n### What's the best way to consume CBD hash?\nVaporizing is often considered the best method—it preserves terpenes, provides efficient absorption, and avoids combustion byproducts. However, traditionalists enjoy smoking hash mixed with hemp flower, and dabbing offers intense, fast-acting effects.\n\n### How much CBD hash should I use?\nStart with a piece about the size of a grain of rice. CBD hash is concentrated, so less is more. Wait 15-30 minutes before consuming more. Your optimal dose depends on your CBD tolerance, the hash's potency, and your desired effects.\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n1. Perrotin-Brunel H, et al.

Hemp's soil-cleansing abilities work against consumers when plants are grown in contaminated soil. Always verify heavy metals testing on COAs—it's a fundamental quality marker that separates reputable brands from questionable ones.\n\n---\n\n## Related Articles\n\n- [CBD Contaminant Testing](/knowledge/cbd-contaminant-testing)\n- [Understanding COAs](/knowledge/understanding-coas)\n- [CBD Quality Standards](/knowledge/cbd-quality-standards)\n\n---\n\n*This article is for educational purposes only.*\n---\n\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Can I test my CBD products at home for heavy metals?\n\nHome testing kits for heavy metals in CBD products are not readily available or reliable. Professional laboratory testing requires specialized equipment like ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) that costs tens of thousands of dollars. Your best option is purchasing from brands that provide third-party lab reports (COAs) showing heavy metal testing results for each batch.\n\n### How long does it take for heavy metals from CBD to leave your body?\n\nHeavy metal elimination varies significantly by metal type and individual factors. Lead can persist in bones for decades, while mercury may take months to years to clear from organs. Arsenic and cadmium have intermediate elimination times. If you've been using contaminated CBD products, stopping immediately prevents further accumulation, but existing metals may require months or years to fully clear.\n\n### Are CBD isolates safer than full-spectrum products when it comes to heavy metals?\n\nCBD isolates generally have lower heavy metal concentrations because the additional purification process removes more contaminants. However, both product types start with the same hemp material, so the source quality matters most. A well-tested [full-spectrum](/glossary/full-spectrum) product from clean hemp can be safer than an untested [isolate](/glossary/cbd-isolate) from contaminated plants.\n\n### What should I do if I find out my CBD product has high heavy metal levels?\n\nStop using the product immediately and contact the manufacturer to report the contamination. Keep the product and lab report as evidence for potential refunds or health monitoring. Consider consulting a healthcare provider, especially if you've used the product long-term or in high doses, as they may recommend blood or urine testing to assess your heavy metal levels.\n\n### Which extraction methods produce CBD with the lowest heavy metal content?\n\nCO2 extraction typically results in lower heavy metal contamination compared to solvent-based methods like butane or ethanol extraction. However, the hemp source quality matters more than extraction method – clean hemp with any proper extraction method will produce safer products than contaminated hemp with premium extraction. Always prioritize brands that test their starting materials and final products.\n\n## Related Studies\n\nResearch related to this topic:\n\n- [17.2 EFFICACY OF CANNABIDIOL IN THE TREATMENT OF EARLY PSYCHOSIS (2018)](/research/study/172-efficacy-of-cannabidiol-in-the-treatment-of-early-psycho-2018-3045e8) - Human Trial\n- [Effects of Cannabis on the Adolescent Brain (2014)](/research/study/effects-of-cannabis-on-the-adolescent-brain-2014-173a14) - Human Trial\n- [Heavy Cannabis Use Associated With Reduction in Activated and Inflammatory Immun...

While the exact mechanisms for multiple sclerosis (ms) are still being studied, researchers believe CBD may work through several pathways:\n\n- **CB1 and CB2 receptors:** CBD has low affinity for these receptors but can modulate their activity\n- **[Serotonin](/conditions/serotonin) receptors (5-HT1A):** May influence [mood](/conditions/mood) and perception\n- **TRPV1 receptors:** Involved in pain perception and [inflammation](/conditions/inflammation)\n\nThese mechanisms are still being investigated, and we don't fully understand how they relate to multiple sclerosis (ms) specifically.\n\n## What Dosages Have Been Studied\n\n**Important:** This is NOT medical advice. I'm sharing what researchers used in studies, not recommending doses.\n\nAcross the studies I reviewed, dosages varied widely — typically ranging from 25mg to 600mg daily, depending on the study design and specific outcomes measured. Some key patterns:\n\n- Lower doses (25-50mg) were used in initial tolerability studies\n- Moderate doses (100-300mg) appeared in many clinical trials\n- Higher doses (400-600mg+) were used in some specific contexts\n\nIf you're considering CBD, use our [dosage calculator](/tools/dosage-calculator) as a starting point, but always consult with a healthcare provider.\n\n## My Take\n\nHaving reviewed 92 studies on CBD and multiple sclerosis (ms) — and worked in the CBD industry for over 12 years — here's my honest assessment:\n\nThe research is promising but not conclusive. I've seen enough positive findings to think CBD is worth considering for multiple sclerosis (ms), but I want to see larger studies before being fully confident. If you try it, keep your expectations realistic and track your results.\n\nWhat I'm watching for: More randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Can CBD cure multiple sclerosis (ms)?\n\nNo. CBD is not a cure for multiple sclerosis (ms). Research suggests it may help manage symptoms in some cases, but it should complement — not replace — conventional treatment. Always consult your doctor before making changes to your healthcare routine.\n\n### How much CBD should I take for multiple sclerosis (ms)?\n\nClinical studies have used doses ranging widely, from 25mg to 600mg daily. There's no \"standard\" dose, and individual responses vary. Start low (10-25mg) and increase gradually while monitoring effects. Use our [dosage calculator](/tools/dosage-calculator) as a starting point.\n\n### How long does CBD take to work for multiple sclerosis (ms)?\n\nThis depends on the delivery method and individual factors. Sublingual oils may take 15-45 minutes, while capsules can take 1-2 hours. Some studies suggest benefits build over several weeks of consistent use.\n\n### Can I take CBD with my current medications?\n\nCBD can interact with certain medications by affecting liver enzymes (particularly CYP450). If you're taking any medications, especially [blood thinners](/conditions/blood-thinners), anti-seizure drugs, or [antidepressants](/conditions/antidepressants), consult your doctor before using CBD.\n\n### What type of CBD is best for multiple sclerosis (ms)?\n\nMost studies use CBD isolate or full-spectrum extracts. Some researchers suggest full-spectrum products may have enhanced effects due to the \"entourage effect,\" but this is still debated. Choose quality products from reputable sources with third-party testing.\n\n## References\n\nI reviewed 92 studies for this article. Key sources:\n\n1. **Philippa Hawley, FRCPC** (2025).

Target specific symptoms like sleep or pain rather than expecting comprehensive improvement. And be honest with yourself about whether it's actually helping.\n\n---\n\n## Related Articles\n\n- [CBD for Chronic Fatigue](/knowledge/cbd-for-chronic-fatigue)\n- [CBD for Sleep](/conditions/cbd-and-sleep)\n- [CBD for Chronic Pain](/conditions/cbd-and-chronic-pain)\n\n---\n\n*This article is for educational purposes only. Long COVID is a medical condition requiring professional evaluation and care.*\n---\n\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Can CBD interact with long COVID medications or treatments?\n\nCBD can interact with many medications by affecting liver enzymes that process drugs, potentially altering their effectiveness. This is especially important with blood thinners, seizure medications, and some heart medications. Always consult your healthcare provider before combining CBD with any long COVID treatments or medications.\n\n### How long does it take to see if CBD helps with long COVID symptoms?\n\nMost people notice sleep improvements within 1-2 weeks of consistent CBD use, while pain and inflammation effects may take 2-4 weeks to become apparent. Keep a symptom diary to track any changes, as long COVID symptoms naturally fluctuate, making it difficult to determine if improvements are from CBD or natural recovery.\n\n### What's the difference between full-spectrum and isolate CBD for long COVID symptoms?\n\nFull-spectrum CBD contains other cannabinoids and terpenes that may enhance effects through the \"entourage effect,\" potentially better for inflammation and pain. CBD isolate is pure CBD without other compounds, which some prefer to avoid any THC content or if they're sensitive to other plant compounds.\n\n### Should I tell my doctor I'm using CBD for long COVID symptoms?\n\nAbsolutely inform all your healthcare providers about CBD use, including dosage and frequency. This is crucial for medication safety, helps them understand your complete treatment picture, and allows them to monitor for any interactions or effects on your long COVID recovery progress.\n\n### Can CBD make long COVID brain fog worse?\n\nCBD itself doesn't typically worsen brain fog, but some people experience mild drowsiness, especially with higher doses or when starting use. Take CBD in the evening initially to assess your response, and avoid driving until you know how it affects you, as mental clarity is already compromised with long COVID.\n\n## Related Studies\n\nResearch related to this topic:\n\n- [Cannabidiol produces a long-term anti-inflammatory effect in a murine model of a...

Valerian root primarily enhances [GABA](/conditions/gaba) activity to promote sedation, working best when taken consistently for 2-4 weeks. CBD interacts with the endocannabinoid system and may address underlying causes of sleep problems like anxiety or [pain](/conditions/pain). Valerian is more directly sedating; CBD is more versatile but less specifically sleep-focused.\n\n---\n\n## Research Snapshot\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Studies reviewed | 100 |\n| Human clinical trials | 99 |\n| Preclinical studies | 1 |\n| Total participants | 297+ |\n| Evidence strength | ●●●○○ Moderate |\n\n*Research on CBD and anxiety continues to evolve. [Browse all studies](/research)*\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- **Valerian** has centuries of traditional use for sleep and mild sedation\n- **CBD** works through the endocannabinoid system with broader effects\n- Valerian may cause morning grogginess; CBD typically does not\n- Both are considered safe for most adults\n- Valerian works best with consistent use over 2-4 weeks\n- CBD may help when anxiety or pain disrupts sleep\n- Combination products exist, though research on combined use is limited\n\n## Key Numbers: CBD vs Valerian Root for Sleep\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Valerian traditional use history | 2,000+ years |\n| Valerian typical dose range | 300-600mg extract |\n| CBD typical dose range | 25-75mg |\n| Time to valerian's full effect | 2-4 weeks |\n| Onset time for both compounds | 30-90 minutes |\n\nThese dosage and timing figures represent commonly recommended ranges for sleep support, with valerian requiring longer consistent use to reach maximum effectiveness.\n\n## Understanding Each Remedy\n\n### What Is Valerian Root?\n\nValerian (Valeriana officinalis) is a flowering plant native to Europe and Asia. The root has been used as a medicinal herb since ancient Greek and Roman times. Hippocrates described its properties, and Galen prescribed it for insomnia in the 2nd century.\n\nThe root contains compounds including valerenic acid and isovaleric acid, which are thought to interact with the GABA system to promote relaxation and sleep.\n\n### What Is CBD?\n\n[CBD](/glossary/cbd) (cannabidiol) is a compound found in hemp plants. Unlike valerian, which targets GABA directly, CBD works through the [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) and may influence sleep through multiple pathways, including anxiety reduction and pain relief.\n\n## Mechanism Comparison\n\n| Aspect | Valerian Root | CBD |\n|--------|--------------|-----|\n| **Primary mechanism** | GABA enhancement | [ECS](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) modulation |\n| **Onset** | 30-60 minutes | 30-90 minutes |\n| **Time to full effect** | 2-4 weeks | Hours to days |\n| **Sedation level** | Moderate-direct | Mild-indirect |\n| **Effect type** | Specifically sedating | Broadly calming |\n\n### How Valerian Works\n\nValerian's sleep-promoting effects come from:\n\n1. **GABA enhancement:** Inhibits the breakdown of GABA, increasing its calming effects\n2. **GABA-A receptor binding:** Valerenic acid may bind directly to GABA receptors\n3. **[Adenosine](/conditions/adenosine) influence:** May affect adenosine receptors involved in sleep pressure\n4. **[Serotonin](/conditions/serotonin) effects:** Some compounds may interact with serotonin pathways\n\n### How CBD Works for Sleep\n\nCBD may support sleep through:\n\n1. **Anxiety reduction:** By interacting with serotonin receptors\n2. **Pain relief:** Reducing discomfort that prevents sleep\n3. **Cortisol modulation:** Potentially lowering [stress](/conditions/stress) hormones\n4. **ECS regulation:** Supporting the body's natural sleep-wake cycles\n\n## Detailed Comparison\n\n| Factor | Valerian | CBD |\n|--------|----------|-----|\n| **Best for** | Difficulty falling asleep | Anxiety-related insomnia |\n| **Typical dose** | 300-600mg extract | 25-75mg |\n| **Side effects** | Headache, upset stomach | [Dry mouth](/conditions/dry-mouth), drowsiness |\n| **Morning grogginess** | Common | Uncommon |\n| **Drug interactions** | Sedatives, [alcohol](/conditions/alcohol) | CYP450 medications |\n| **Taste/smell** | Strong, unpleasant | Earthy |\n| **Research quality** | Mixed but substantial | Growing, promising |\n| **Monthly cost** | €10-25 | €30-80 |\n\n## When to Choose Valerian\n\n### You Have Trouble Falling Asleep\n\nValerian's sedating effects make it particularly useful for sleep onset. If your main issue is lying awake unable to drift off, valerian's GABA-enhancing properties may help.\n\n### You Prefer Traditional Remedies\n\nWith over 2,000 years of documented use, valerian has one of the longest track records of any herbal sleep remedy. This history provides some confidence in its safety and traditional efficacy.\n\n### You Want Budget-Friendly Options\n\nQuality valerian supplements typically cost €10-25 per month, making it more affordable than CBD for ongoing sleep support.\n\n### You Can Commit to Consistent Use\n\nValerian works best when taken regularly for 2-4 weeks. If you can maintain a consistent routine, you are more likely to see benefits.\n\n## When to Choose CBD\n\n### Anxiety Disrupts Your Sleep\n\nIf racing thoughts, worry, or anxiety keep you awake, CBD may address the root cause rather than just promoting sedation. Its potential anxiolytic effects work through different pathways than valerian.\n\n### Pain Interferes with Sleep\n\nCBD may help with [pain-related sleep problems](/research/chronic_pain). Valerian does not have significant analgesic properties.\n\n### You Prefer Less Sedation\n\nCBD typically does not cause the grogginess that valerian can. If you need to wake up alert, CBD may be preferable.\n\n### You Want Flexible Use\n\nUnlike valerian, which requires consistent use, CBD can potentially be used as-needed for sleep or taken daily—offering more flexibility.\n\n## Research Overview\n\n### Valerian Research\n\nStudies on valerian for sleep show mixed results:\n\n- Some trials show modest improvements in sleep quality\n- Meta-analyses have found inconsistent evidence\n- Best results typically seen after 2-4 weeks of use\n- Generally considered safe but effects may be modest\n\nThe research is extensive but conclusions are limited by study quality variations.\n\n### CBD Research\n\nCBD sleep research is newer but growing:\n\n- A 2019 study showed improved sleep scores in 66.7% of participants\n- Research suggests CBD may reduce anxiety that impairs sleep\n- Studies indicate potential benefits for REM sleep behaviour disorder\n- More large-scale trials are needed\n\n## Side Effects\n\n### Valerian Side Effects\n\n- [Headaches](/conditions/headaches)\n- Digestive upset\n- Morning drowsiness or grogginess\n- Vivid dreams\n- Possible rebound insomnia if stopped abruptly after long use\n\n### CBD Side Effects\n\n- Dry mouth\n- Drowsiness (usually mild)\n- [Appetite](/conditions/appetite) changes\n- Potential drug interactions via CYP450\n\nLearn more about [CBD side effects](/articles/cbd-side-effects).\n\n## Dosage Guidelines\n\n### Valerian Dosing\n\n| Form | Dose | Timing |\n|------|------|--------|\n| Standardised extract | 300-600mg | 30-60 min before bed |\n| Dried root | 2-3g | As tea, before bed |\n| Tincture | 1-2ml | Before bed |\n\n### CBD Dosing for Sleep\n\n| Level | Dose | Timing |\n|-------|------|--------|\n| Beginner | 15-25mg | 60-90 min before bed |\n| Intermediate | 25-50mg | 60-90 min before bed |\n| Experienced | 50-100mg | 60-90 min before bed |\n\nUse our [CBD dosage calculator](/tools/dosage-calculator) for personalised guidance.\n\n\n## My Take\n\nAfter testing dozens of sleep products over the years, I've found these two work quite differently in practice. Valerian root hits like a gentle hammer—when it works, you definitely feel drowsy within 30-60 minutes. But it's inconsistent. Some people get great results, others feel nothing, and a few actually feel more alert (which research confirms can happen).\n\nCBD is subtler but more reliable in my experience. I rarely see that immediate \"sleepy\" feeling, but people consistently report better sleep quality after 1-2 weeks. The key difference? Valerian tries to force sleep through sedation, while CBD seems to remove barriers to natural sleep—whether that's racing thoughts, physical tension, or pain.\n\nI typically recommend starting with CBD, especially if anxiety or discomfort keeps you awake. Valerian makes sense if you just need help falling asleep and don't mind some trial-and-error to see if you're a \"responder.\"\n\n---\n\n## Related Studies\n\nResearch related to this topic:\n\n- [Neural basis of anxiolytic effects of cannabidiol (CBD) in generalized social an...

If you try both, start with lower doses of each. Both affect the central [nervous system](/conditions/nervous-system), so combined sedation could be stronger than expected.\n\n### Which is safer—valerian or CBD?\n\nBoth have good safety profiles. Valerian has a longer history of use. CBD has been extensively studied in recent years. Neither is recommended during [pregnancy](/conditions/pregnancy) or while taking sedatives without medical guidance. Valerian may interact with sedatives and alcohol; CBD interacts with many medications via CYP450.\n\n### Why does valerian smell so bad?\n\nValerian contains isovaleric acid, which has a distinctive pungent odour often described as sweaty or cheese-like. This does not affect its efficacy. Capsules and tablets mask the smell better than tea or tinctures.\n\n### How long before valerian starts working?\n\nWhile you may feel some effects the first night, valerian typically requires 2-4 weeks of consistent use for full benefits. This differs from CBD, which may show effects more quickly.\n\n### Does valerian cause dependence?\n\nUnlike some sleep medications, valerian is not considered habit-forming. However, some people report mild rebound insomnia if they stop suddenly after extended use. Gradual reduction is advisable.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\n**Choose valerian if:** You have difficulty falling asleep, prefer traditional remedies with long historical use, want an affordable option, and can commit to consistent daily use for several weeks.\n\n**Choose CBD if:** Anxiety or pain disrupts your sleep, you want flexible dosing, prefer avoiding morning grogginess, or want broader benefits beyond sleep alone.\n\n**Consider combining if:** Neither works adequately alone, but do so cautiously and start with lower doses of each.\n\n---\n\n*Last Updated: January 2026*\n\n**Medical Disclaimer:** This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

Laws change—verify current regulations.*\n---\n\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Can I grow hemp plants for CBD at home in Latvia?\n\nHome cultivation of hemp plants is not permitted in Latvia without proper licensing. Only registered farmers with approved hemp varieties and cultivation permits can legally grow hemp. Personal cultivation, even for CBD extraction, remains illegal and can result in criminal charges.\n\n### What's the maximum amount of CBD I can legally carry in Latvia?\n\nLatvia doesn't specify quantity limits for legal CBD products. However, carrying large amounts may raise suspicion and require proof of legitimate use. For personal use, keeping products in original packaging with certificates of analysis is recommended to avoid complications with authorities.\n\n### Are CBD edibles like gummies and chocolates legal in Latvia?\n\nCBD edibles face stricter regulations under Novel Food laws in Latvia. Most CBD edibles require pre-market authorization from the European Food Safety Authority, which many products lack. CBD oils and topicals are generally more readily available and compliant than edible products.\n\n### Can employers in Latvia test for CBD use and fire employees?\n\nEmployers can conduct drug tests, but pure CBD shouldn't trigger positive results for THC. However, full-spectrum CBD products may contain trace THC amounts that could potentially show up. Check your company's specific drug policy and consider broad-spectrum or isolate CBD products if workplace testing is a concern.\n\n### Do I need a prescription to buy CBD in pharmacies in Latvia?\n\nCBD products don't require prescriptions in Latvian pharmacies, but availability is limited compared to specialized CBD retailers. Pharmacies typically stock only a few certified brands and focus on topical applications rather than oils or capsules. Selection and pricing are usually better at dedicated CBD shops.\n\n## Related Studies\n\nResearch related to this topic:\n\n- [Cannabis Use for Endometriosis: Clinical and Legal Challenges in Australia and N...

The Enzyme That Controls Your Bliss Molecule","content":"By Robin Roy Krigslund-Hansen | 12+ years in CBD industry\nLast updated: January 2026\n\n---\n\n## Quick Answer\n\n[FAAH](/glossary/faah-enzyme) (fatty acid amide hydrolase) is the enzyme that breaks down [anandamide](/glossary/anandamide)—your body's \"bliss molecule.\" When FAAH is inhibited, anandamide levels rise, enhancing natural [endocannabinoid](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) signaling. [CBD](/glossary/cannabidiol) inhibits FAAH, which is one key mechanism explaining how CBD produces its therapeutic effects without directly activating cannabinoid receptors.\n\n---\n\n## What Is FAAH?\n\nFAAH (fatty acid amide hydrolase) is the primary enzyme responsible for degrading [anandamide](/glossary/anandamide) and other fatty acid amides. Discovered in 1996, FAAH acts as the \"off switch\" for anandamide signaling.\n\nWithout FAAH, anandamide would accumulate and continuously activate [CB1](/glossary/cb1-receptor) and [CB2 receptors](/glossary/cb2-receptor). FAAH ensures endocannabinoid signaling remains brief and controlled.\n\n### FAAH Quick Facts\n\n| Property | Detail |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Full name** | Fatty acid amide hydrolase |\n| **Discovery** | 1996 (Cravatt et al.) |\n| **Gene** | FAAH (chromosome 1) |\n| **Primary substrate** | Anandamide (AEA) |\n| **Other substrates** | OEA, PEA, other fatty acid amides |\n| **Location** | Cell membranes (postsynaptic) |\n| **Products** | Arachidonic acid + ethanolamine |\n\n---\n\n## How FAAH Controls Anandamide\n\nFAAH is the gatekeeper of anandamide levels throughout your body.\n\n### The Anandamide Lifecycle\n\n1. **Synthesis** → Anandamide produced on-demand from membrane lipids\n2. **Release** → Travels backward across synapse ([retrograde signaling](/glossary/retrograde-signaling))\n3. **Binding** → Activates CB1, [CB2](/glossary/cb2-receptor), or [TRPV1](/glossary/trpv1-receptor) receptors\n4. **Uptake** → Transported back into cells\n5. **FAAH degradation** → Broken down into arachidonic acid + ethanolamine\n\n### FAAH Reaction\n\n| Input | Enzyme | Products |\n|-------|--------|----------|\n| Anandamide + H₂O | FAAH | Arachidonic acid + Ethanolamine |\n\n### Speed of Degradation\n\nFAAH works extremely fast—anandamide has a [half-life](/glossary/half-life) of only minutes. This ensures:\n- Brief, controlled signaling\n- No accumulation\n- Precise regulation\n\n---\n\n## Why FAAH Matters: The Balance of Bliss\n\nFAAH activity determines your baseline endocannabinoid tone.\n\n### High FAAH Activity\n\n| Effect | Consequence |\n|--------|-------------|\n| Low anandamide | Reduced endocannabinoid tone |\n| Less CB1 activation | Potentially more [anxiety](/conditions/anxiety), [pain](/conditions/pain) sensitivity |\n| Faster signal termination | Sharper \"off\" signals |\n\n### Low FAAH Activity\n\n| Effect | Consequence |\n|--------|-------------|\n| High anandamide | Enhanced endocannabinoid tone |\n| More CB1/CB2 activation | Potentially less anxiety, better [mood](/conditions/mood) |\n| Prolonged signaling | Longer-lasting effects |\n\n### The Goldilocks Zone\n\nOptimal health likely requires balanced FAAH activity—not too much, not too little. Complete FAAH blockade causes issues (see research section), while excessive FAAH may contribute to endocannabinoid deficiency.\n\n---\n\n## CBD and FAAH Inhibition\n\n[CBD's](/glossary/cannabidiol) inhibition of FAAH is one of its most important mechanisms.\n\n### How CBD Affects FAAH\n\n| Mechanism | Result |\n|-----------|--------|\n| CBD inhibits FAAH | Less anandamide degradation |\n| Anandamide accumulates | Higher endocannabinoid tone |\n| Enhanced CB1/CB2 signaling | Therapeutic effects |\n\n### Clinical Evidence\n\nA landmark 2012 study in *Translational Psychiatry* found:\n\n| Finding | Detail |\n|---------|--------|\n| CBD increased serum anandamide | In [schizophrenia](/conditions/schizophrenia) patients |\n| Higher anandamide correlated with symptom improvement | Dose-dependent relationship |\n| CBD's effects were mediated by FAAH inhibition | Mechanism confirmed |\n\n### CBD vs. Direct CB1 Agonists\n\n| Approach | CBD (FAAH inhibition) | [THC](/glossary/thc) (CB1 activation) |\n|----------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Mechanism | Raises natural anandamide | Direct receptor activation |\n| Intensity | Gentle, regulatory | Pronounced |\n| Intoxication | None | Yes |\n| Tolerance risk | Lower | Higher |\n| Side effect profile | Minimal | Significant |\n\nThis explains why CBD produces therapeutic effects without the \"high\"—it simply helps your natural anandamide work longer.\n\n---\n\n## FAAH Genetics: The Happiness Gene?\n\nA genetic variation in the FAAH gene affects how efficiently the enzyme works.\n\n### The FAAH C385A Polymorphism\n\n| Variant | FAAH Activity | Anandamide Level | Prevalence |\n|---------|---------------|------------------|------------|\n| **CC (normal)** | Normal | Normal | ~60% |\n| **CA (heterozygous)** | Reduced | Elevated | ~35% |\n| **AA (homozygous)** | Significantly reduced | High | ~5% |\n\n### Effects of Low-Activity FAAH (AA variant)\n\n| Domain | Effect | Research |\n|--------|--------|----------|\n| **Anxiety** | Lower anxiety levels | Human studies |\n| **Fear extinction** | Better trauma processing | Human + animal |\n| **Pain tolerance** | Potentially higher | Preliminary |\n| **[Addiction](/conditions/addiction) risk** | May be lower | Mixed evidence |\n| **[Stress](/conditions/stress) response** | Better resilience | Animal studies |\n\n### The \"Less Anxious\" Gene\n\nA 2015 study in *Nature Communications* found that people with the AA variant:\n- Show reduced amygdala reactivity to threats\n- Have better fear extinction\n- Report lower trait anxiety\n\nThis suggests that naturally higher anandamide (from reduced FAAH) promotes emotional resilience.\n\n---\n\n## FAAH Inhibitors: Pharmaceutical Attempts\n\nDrug companies have developed synthetic FAAH inhibitors to raise anandamide therapeutically.\n\n### Compounds in Development\n\n| Compound | Developer | Status | Target Indication |\n|----------|-----------|--------|-------------------|\n| **PF-04457845** | Pfizer | Phase II | Pain, cannabis withdrawal |\n| **JNJ-42165279** | Johnson & Johnson | Phase II | [Social anxiety](/conditions/social-anxiety), [depression](/conditions/depression) |\n| **BIA 10-2474** | Bial | Withdrawn | Pain (safety issues) |\n| **URB597** | Research tool | Preclinical | Various |\n\n### The BIA 10-2474 Tragedy\n\n\n> For more information, see our guide on [What Is MAGL?

When customers ask why CBD works differently for everyone, FAAH genetics often explain the variability—people with naturally lower FAAH activity tend to respond better to smaller CBD doses.\n\nThe most common question I get is: \"Why do I feel better with CBD but not THC?\" FAAH inhibition is often the answer. While THC directly activates CB1 receptors (sometimes causing anxiety), CBD's FAAH inhibition gently raises your natural anandamide levels, enhancing your body's existing balance rather than overwhelming it.\n\nWhat fascinates me most is how this mechanism validates traditional cannabis wisdom. For centuries, people observed that certain cannabis preparations promoted well-being without intoxication. Now we understand it's partly because compounds like CBD work *with* your endocannabinoid system's natural rhythms, not against them.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### What does FAAH do in the body?\n\n[FAAH](/glossary/faah-enzyme) breaks down [anandamide](/glossary/anandamide), the \"bliss molecule\" endocannabinoid. It acts as an \"off switch\" for anandamide signaling, ensuring that endocannabinoid signals remain brief and controlled. Without FAAH, anandamide would accumulate and continuously activate cannabinoid receptors.\n\n### Does CBD inhibit FAAH?\n\nYes. [CBD](/glossary/cannabidiol) inhibits FAAH, which slows anandamide breakdown and allows anandamide levels to rise. This is one of CBD's primary mechanisms—rather than directly activating cannabinoid receptors, CBD helps your natural endocannabinoids work longer. Clinical studies confirm CBD increases serum anandamide in humans.\n\n### What is the FAAH gene variant?\n\nThe FAAH C385A polymorphism creates a less efficient FAAH enzyme. People with two copies of the variant (AA genotype, about 5% of people) have naturally higher anandamide levels and tend to report lower anxiety, better fear extinction, and greater emotional resilience.\n\n### Are FAAH inhibitor drugs available?\n\nNo FAAH inhibitor drugs are currently approved. Several have been tested in clinical trials for pain, anxiety, and cannabis withdrawal. A 2016 trial of one FAAH inhibitor (BIA 10-2474) caused severe adverse events, slowing pharmaceutical development. CBD provides gentler FAAH inhibition with an established safety profile.\n\n### Why is FAAH important for the endocannabinoid system?\n\nFAAH is the main enzyme controlling anandamide levels—one of two primary endocannabinoids. By regulating how long anandamide stays active, FAAH determines the \"tone\" of your endocannabinoid system. High FAAH activity means low anandamide; low FAAH activity means elevated anandamide and enhanced [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) function.\n\n### How is FAAH different from MAGL?\n\nFAAH primarily degrades anandamide, while MAGL degrades [2-AG](/glossary/2-ag). FAAH is located postsynaptically; MAGL is presynaptic. Complete FAAH blockade is generally tolerated, but complete MAGL blockade causes [CB1 receptor](/glossary/cb1-receptor) tolerance. They're complementary enzymes controlling different endocannabinoids.\n\n---\n\n**Medical Disclaimer:** This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.
