Kenyan customs officers are trained to identify cannabis-derived products, and possession can result in court appearances, fines up to 1 million Kenyan shillings, or imprisonment up to 10 years depending on the amount.\n\n### Can I buy CBD products locally in Nairobi or other Kenyan cities?\n\nNo legitimate retailers sell CBD products in Kenya as they're completely prohibited. Any products claiming to be CBD sold locally are either illegal black market items or mislabeled products. Purchasing or possessing these exposes you to the same criminal penalties as importing CBD from abroad.\n\n### Are there any exceptions for CBD prescriptions from other countries?\n\nKenya doesn't recognize foreign CBD prescriptions or medical cannabis recommendations. Even if you have a valid prescription from the US, Europe, or other countries where CBD is legal, Kenyan law makes no exceptions for medical use. The prescription holds no legal value at borders or in court.\n\n### What about hemp-derived skincare products that contain trace amounts of CBD?\n\nAll [hemp](/glossary/hemp) and cannabis-derived products are prohibited regardless of CBD concentration or intended use. Skincare products, cosmetics, or supplements containing any amount of CBD fall under the same restrictions as pure [CBD oil](/glossary/cbd-oil). Even products with less than 0.3% THC are illegal in Kenya.\n\n### How long do CBD detection methods remain effective after consumption?\n\nCBD can be detected in blood for 2-5 days, urine for 3-15 days, and hair follicles for up to 90 days after last use. If you're planning to visit Kenya, stop using all CBD products at least 30 days before travel to avoid any potential issues with [drug testing](/conditions/drug-testing) at airports or during police encounters.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n- [CBD Laws in Africa](/knowledge/cbd-laws-africa)\n- [Traveling with CBD](/guides/traveling-with-cbd)\n\n---\n\n*This article is for informational purposes only.
