Based on the 2 studies I've reviewed, I have to be direct: there's very little research specifically on CBD and cbd for parents. The few studies that exist are preliminary, and I can't draw meaningful conclusions from such limited data.\n\n\n## Related Articles\n\n- [CBD for Parents: Managing Parental Stress, Sleep & Self-Care](/articles/cbd-for-parents)\n\n---\n\n## Research Snapshot\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| **Studies Reviewed** | 2 |\n| **Human Clinical Studies** | 2 |\n| **Systematic Reviews** | 0 |\n| **Total Participants** | 0 |\n| **Research Period** | 2017-2022 |\n| **Evidence Strength** | ●○○○○ Insufficient |\n\n## What the Research Shows\n\n### The Best Evidence (Clinical Trials)\n\nThe strongest evidence comes from 2 human studies, including 0 randomized controlled trials. \n\nA [2017 study](/research/study/report-from-a-survey-of-parents-regarding-the-use-of-cannabi-2017-fba247) found that here is a 99-word plain-language summary of the research study:\n\nthis study looked at how mexican parents used medical cannabis (cbd oil) to treat their [children](/conditions/children)'s severe, hard-to-control [epilepsy](/conditions/epilepsy). th...\n\nA [2022 study](/research/study/survey-of-local-cannabidiol-use-in-parents-of-children-with-2022-8c710e) found that here's a 97-word plain-language summary of the study:\n\nresearchers surveyed parents of children with epilepsy in thailand to find out how many were using cbd oil. they wanted to know what people thoug...\n\n### What Reviews Conclude\n\nNo systematic reviews have been published specifically on CBD and cbd for parents. This gap in the literature makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.\n\n### Supporting Evidence\n\nLimited preclinical research exists for this condition.

(2017)\n\nHere is a 99-word plain-language summary of the research study:\n\nThis study looked at how Mexican parents used medical cannabis (CBD oil) to treat their children's severe, hard-to-control epilepsy. The researchers surveyed 53 parents, mostly from Mexico. Most of the children had difficult types of epilepsy like Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Many had tried 9 or more seizure medications without success.\n\nAfter using CBD oil, 81% of parents said their child's seizures decreased. Over half had a moderate or significant drop in seizures, and 16% became seizure-free. Some were also able to reduce the number of seizure medications they were taking. The parents reported only mild side effects like changes in [appetite](/conditions/appetite) or [sleep](/conditions/sleep).\n\nThe results suggest CBD oil may help treat severe childhood epilepsy, but more research is still needed.\n\n**Sample:** Not specified participants | **Type:** human | **Quality Score:** N/A/100\n\n[View study summary](/research/study/report-from-a-survey-of-parents-regarding-the-use-of-cannabi-2017-fba247)\n\n### Survey of local cannabidiol use in parents of children with epilepsy in Thailand... (2022)\n\nHere's a 97-word plain-language summary of the study:\n\nResearchers surveyed parents of children with epilepsy in Thailand to find out how many were using CBD oil. They wanted to know what people thought about CBD and how much they knew about it. \n\nThe study involved 200 parents. Over half were using CBD oil to treat their child's epilepsy. Most believed CBD could help, but many also had misconceptions, like thinking it gets you high. Only about a quarter of parents felt they had a good understanding of CBD.\n\nThe results show CBD oil is popular, but more education is needed so parents can make informed decisions about using it for their children's epilepsy.\n\n**Sample:** Not specified participants | **Type:** human | **Quality Score:** N/A/100\n\n[View study summary](/research/study/survey-of-local-cannabidiol-use-in-parents-of-children-with-2022-8c710e)\n\n## How CBD Might Help with CBD for Parents\n\nCBD interacts with the body's [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) (ECS), which plays a role in regulating various physiological processes. While the exact mechanisms for cbd for parents are still being studied, researchers believe CBD may work through several pathways:\n\n- **CB1 and CB2 receptors:** CBD has low affinity for these receptors but can modulate their activity\n- **[Serotonin](/conditions/serotonin) receptors (5-HT1A):** May influence [mood](/conditions/mood) and perception\n- **TRPV1 receptors:** Involved in [pain](/conditions/pain) perception and [inflammation](/conditions/inflammation)\n\nThese mechanisms are still being investigated, and we don't fully understand how they relate to cbd for parents specifically.\n\n## My Take\n\nHaving reviewed 2 studies on CBD and cbd for parents — and worked in the CBD industry for over 12 years — here's my honest assessment:\n\nI have to be direct: there's almost no research on CBD for cbd for parents. I can't recommend it based on evidence because the evidence doesn't exist yet. Some people try it based on CBD's general effects, but you'd be experimenting, not following science.\n\nWhat I'm watching for: Any foundational research that could justify clinical studies.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Can CBD cure cbd for parents?\n\nNo. CBD is not a cure for cbd for parents. Research suggests it may help manage symptoms in some cases, but it should complement — not replace — conventional treatment. Always consult your doctor before making changes to your healthcare routine.\n\n### How much CBD should I take for cbd for parents?\n\nClinical studies have used doses ranging widely, from 25mg to 600mg daily. There's no \"standard\" dose, and individual responses vary. Start low (10-25mg) and increase gradually while monitoring effects. Use our [dosage calculator](/tools/dosage-calculator) as a starting point.\n\n### How long does CBD take to work for cbd for parents?\n\nThis depends on the delivery method and individual factors. Sublingual oils may take 15-45 minutes, while capsules can take 1-2 hours. Some studies suggest benefits build over several weeks of consistent use.\n\n### Can I take CBD with my current medications?\n\nCBD can interact with certain medications by affecting liver enzymes (particularly CYP450). If you're taking any medications, especially [blood thinners](/conditions/blood-thinners), anti-seizure drugs, or [antidepressants](/conditions/antidepressants), consult your doctor before using CBD.\n\n### What type of CBD is best for cbd for parents?\n\nMost studies use CBD isolate or full-spectrum extracts. Some researchers suggest full-spectrum products may have enhanced effects due to the \"entourage effect,\" but this is still debated. Choose quality products from reputable sources with third-party testing.\n\n## References\n\nI reviewed 2 studies for this article. Key sources:\n\n1. **Carlos G. Aguirre-Velázquez** (2017).
