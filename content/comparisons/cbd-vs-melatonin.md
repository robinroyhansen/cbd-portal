# CBD vs Melatonin: Which Is Better for Sleep?

> **Quick Answer:** CBD and melatonin help sleep through different mechanisms. [Melatonin](/glossary/melatonin) signals your body it's time to sleep—ideal for jet lag and schedule issues. [CBD](/glossary/cbd) reduces anxiety and promotes relaxation, helping those whose insomnia stems from stress. Melatonin works immediately; CBD requires 2-4 weeks. For anxiety-driven sleep issues, choose CBD. For circadian rhythm problems, choose melatonin. Many people combine both.

## Key Takeaways

- Melatonin directly regulates your [circadian rhythm](/glossary/circadian-rhythm); CBD promotes relaxation indirectly through the [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system)
- Melatonin works the first night (20-30 min onset); CBD requires 2-4 weeks of consistent use for full sleep benefits
- CBD is better for anxiety-related insomnia; melatonin is better for jet lag, shift work, and schedule disruption
- Both are generally well-tolerated, but melatonin causes morning grogginess in 15-20% of users while CBD rarely does
- Combining CBD + melatonin is increasingly popular and research suggests they work synergistically

## What Is CBD?

[Cannabidiol (CBD)](/glossary/cannabidiol) is a non-intoxicating compound extracted from [hemp](/glossary/hemp) plants. Unlike [THC](/glossary/thc), CBD won't get you high or impair cognitive function. It interacts with your body's [endocannabinoid system (ECS)](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system), which regulates sleep, mood, pain, and stress responses.

For sleep specifically, CBD may help through several mechanisms:

- **Reducing anxiety:** A landmark [2019 study](/research/study/shannon-2019-cannabidiol-anxiety-sleep) in *The Permanente Journal* followed 72 adults with anxiety and poor sleep. After one month of CBD treatment (25-75mg/day), 79% experienced reduced anxiety and 66% reported improved sleep scores ([Shannon et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30624194/)).

- **Calming the nervous system:** CBD interacts with [serotonin receptors](/glossary/serotonin) (5-HT1A) and may enhance [GABA](/glossary/gaba) signalling—both pathways involved in relaxation and sleep initiation.

- **Addressing pain:** Chronic pain disrupts sleep for millions. CBD's potential [anti-inflammatory](/glossary/anti-inflammatory) properties may help break the pain-poor sleep cycle ([Vučković et al., 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30152161/)).

- **Regulating cortisol:** Some research suggests CBD may reduce [cortisol](/glossary/cortisol) secretion, the stress hormone that interferes with deep sleep when elevated at night ([Zuardi et al., 1993](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8257923/)).

CBD is available as [oils/tinctures](/articles/cbd-oil-guide), [capsules](/articles/cbd-capsules-guide), [gummies](/articles/cbd-gummies-guide), and sleep-specific formulas that combine CBD with other compounds.

## What Is Melatonin?

[Melatonin](/glossary/melatonin) is a hormone naturally produced by your pineal gland when darkness falls. It doesn't make you sleepy directly—instead, it signals your body that it's time to prepare for sleep. Think of it as your internal "sunset" signal that initiates your sleep cascade.

Your natural melatonin production can be disrupted by:
- Blue light exposure from screens (suppresses melatonin by up to 50%)
- Irregular sleep schedules
- Shift work
- Jet lag and time zone changes
- Ageing (production decreases 10-15% per decade after age 30)

Supplemental melatonin is synthetically produced but chemically identical to endogenous melatonin. A [2013 meta-analysis](/research/study/ferracioli-2013-melatonin-meta-analysis) of 19 studies found melatonin reduced sleep onset time by 7 minutes and increased total sleep by 8 minutes compared to placebo—modest but statistically significant ([Ferracioli-Oda et al., 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23691095/)).

Melatonin is particularly effective for:
- **Jet lag:** Helps reset your [circadian rhythm](/glossary/circadian-rhythm) to a new time zone
- **Delayed sleep phase syndrome:** When your natural sleep time is hours later than desired
- **Shift work:** Establishes sleep patterns despite irregular schedules
- **Older adults:** Who naturally produce less melatonin

## Key Differences Explained

### Mechanism of Action

The fundamental difference lies in *how* each substance works:

**Melatonin** directly binds to melatonin receptors (MT1 and MT2) in your brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus—your master circadian clock. This signals that darkness has fallen and initiates physiological preparation for sleep: body temperature drops, alertness decreases, and sleep pressure builds.

**CBD** works indirectly through multiple pathways. It modulates the [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system), influences [serotonin](/glossary/serotonin) and [GABA](/glossary/gaba) receptors, and may reduce cortisol. Rather than triggering sleep directly, CBD addresses underlying factors—anxiety, pain, stress—that prevent sleep.

**Key insight:** Melatonin tells your body *when* to sleep. CBD helps remove *barriers* to sleep.

### Speed of Effects

**Melatonin** works quickly. Take it 30 minutes before bed, and you'll likely feel its effects that same night. This makes it excellent for acute situations like jet lag or a one-off schedule disruption.

**CBD** requires patience. While you may feel more relaxed the first night, significant sleep improvements typically emerge after 2-4 weeks of consistent daily use. The [Shannon et al. study](/research/study/shannon-2019-cannabidiol-anxiety-sleep) noted that sleep scores fluctuated over time, suggesting CBD's effects build gradually.

### Duration of Use

**Melatonin** is generally recommended for short-term use (days to weeks). While not addictive, some research suggests long-term high-dose use may downregulate your body's natural melatonin production. Most sleep specialists recommend using it situationally.

**CBD** appears safe for extended use. Studies lasting 3-6 months haven't shown tolerance development or withdrawal effects. For chronic conditions like ongoing anxiety or pain-related insomnia, CBD may be more suitable for long-term management.

### Side Effects Comparison

**Melatonin side effects:**
- Morning grogginess (15-20% of users, especially at doses >3mg)
- Headaches (7%)
- Dizziness
- Vivid dreams or nightmares
- Nausea

**CBD side effects:**
- Dry mouth (most common)
- Mild drowsiness
- Diarrhoea at high doses (>300mg)
- Potential [drug interactions](/tools/interactions) via [CYP450](/glossary/cyp450) enzymes

## When to Choose CBD for Sleep

CBD may be your better choice if:

- **Your insomnia stems from anxiety:** If racing thoughts, worry, or stress keep you awake, CBD's anxiolytic properties target the root cause. [Research suggests](/research?topic=anxiety) CBD reduces anxiety in most users.

- **You have chronic pain:** Pain and sleep form a vicious cycle. CBD's potential [anti-inflammatory](/glossary/anti-inflammatory) and analgesic effects may help both issues simultaneously. See our [CBD for pain guide](/conditions/chronic-pain).

- **You want daytime benefits too:** CBD can be used during the day for anxiety without causing drowsiness, while also supporting better sleep at night. It's one solution for multiple concerns.

- **Melatonin makes you groggy:** If you've tried melatonin and wake up feeling hungover, CBD rarely causes this issue.

- **You need long-term support:** For ongoing sleep difficulties, CBD's safety profile supports extended use better than melatonin.

**Recommended products:** [Full-spectrum CBD oil](/articles/full-spectrum-vs-isolate) taken [sublingually](/glossary/sublingual) 1 hour before bed offers the fastest absorption for sleep purposes.

## When to Choose Melatonin for Sleep

Melatonin may be your better choice if:

- **You're dealing with jet lag:** Melatonin is specifically effective for resetting your circadian rhythm. Take it at bedtime in your *destination* time zone.

- **You work shifts:** Irregular schedules confuse your internal clock. Melatonin signals "sleep time" regardless of when that is.

- **Your sleep timing is off:** If you naturally fall asleep at 2am but need to sleep at 10pm, melatonin can help shift your schedule earlier (this is called *chronotherapy*).

- **You need immediate results:** Unlike CBD, melatonin works from the first dose—useful for acute situations.

- **You're over 50:** Natural melatonin production decreases with age. Supplementation directly replaces what your body produces less of.

- **Budget is a concern:** Melatonin supplements cost €5-15/month versus €30-60+ for quality CBD.

**Dosing tip:** Research shows [0.5-1mg is often as effective as 5mg](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15649737/) with fewer side effects. Start low.

## Can You Take CBD and Melatonin Together?

Yes—and many people do with excellent results. Combining CBD and melatonin is increasingly popular because they work through complementary mechanisms:

- **Melatonin** signals your body it's time to sleep
- **CBD** helps you relax and quiets the anxiety that might keep you awake

A [2022 survey study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35400190/) found that CBD+melatonin combination products were among the most commonly used for sleep, with users reporting high satisfaction rates.

### CBD + Melatonin Products

Several brands offer combination formulas typically containing:
- 10-25mg CBD per serving
- 1-3mg melatonin per serving
- Often additional ingredients: [L-theanine](/glossary/l-theanine), chamomile, valerian, or [CBN](/glossary/cbn)

### Protocol for Combining

1. **Week 1-2:** Establish your CBD baseline first. Take 25mg CBD 1 hour before bed nightly.
2. **Week 3:** If needed, add 0.5-1mg melatonin 30 minutes before bed.
3. **Adjust:** Increase CBD to 50mg if anxiety persists. Keep melatonin under 3mg.
4. **Track:** Use a sleep journal or app to monitor what works.

## My Take: 12 Years in the CBD Industry

*By Robin Roy Krigslund-Hansen, Founder & Editor*

After 12 years working with CBD products and talking to thousands of customers about sleep, here's what I've observed:

**Most people with anxiety-driven insomnia do better with CBD.** If you lie awake with racing thoughts, replaying the day, or worrying about tomorrow—CBD addresses that directly. Melatonin won't quiet your mind.

**Melatonin works best for specific situations.** Jet lag, a temporary schedule change, helping older adults whose natural melatonin has declined. It's a targeted tool, not a nightly solution.

**The combination is often ideal.** Our best-selling sleep products combine 25mg CBD with 1mg melatonin. The melatonin provides the "it's bedtime" signal while CBD handles the relaxation. Users consistently report this works better than either alone.

**Start with CBD if you're unsure.** It addresses more potential causes of poor sleep (anxiety, pain, stress) and is safer for long-term use. Add melatonin later if you need the circadian boost.

**Quality matters enormously.** I've seen people fail with cheap CBD isolate and succeed with quality [full-spectrum](/articles/full-spectrum-vs-isolate) products. For sleep specifically, look for products containing [CBN](/glossary/cbn)—it shows promising sedative properties.

## Safety Considerations

### CBD Safety

CBD is generally well-tolerated, but important considerations include:

- **Drug interactions:** CBD inhibits [CYP450 enzymes](/glossary/cyp450), affecting how your body processes many medications. Use our [drug interaction checker](/tools/interactions) before starting CBD. Common interactions include blood thinners, some heart medications, and certain antidepressants.

- **Quality concerns:** The CBD market remains poorly regulated. Always choose products with [third-party lab testing (COA)](/articles/understanding-cbd-coas) verifying potency and purity.

- **Pregnancy/breastfeeding:** Not recommended due to limited safety data.

### Melatonin Safety

- **Dose matters:** Higher isn't better. [Research shows](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15649737/) 0.5mg can be as effective as 5mg with fewer side effects.

- **Timing is crucial:** Taking melatonin too early or late can shift your schedule in unwanted ways.

- **Not for everyone:** People with autoimmune conditions, depression, or those taking immunosuppressants should consult a doctor first.

### Who Should Avoid These Supplements

**Avoid CBD if you:**
- Take blood thinners (warfarin, etc.)
- Take medications metabolised by CYP450 (check [our tool](/tools/interactions))
- Are pregnant or breastfeeding
- Have liver disease

**Avoid melatonin if you:**
- Have an autoimmune condition
- Take immunosuppressants
- Experience depression (may worsen in some cases)
- Are under 18 (except under medical supervision)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is CBD or melatonin better for chronic insomnia?

It depends on the underlying cause. If anxiety, stress, or pain drives your insomnia, [CBD shows promise](/research?topic=sleep). If your circadian rhythm is disrupted (you're wired at night, sleepy in morning), melatonin directly addresses this. For chronic insomnia, many sleep specialists now recommend trying CBD first since it's safer for long-term use, then adding low-dose melatonin if circadian support is needed.

### Can I take CBD and melatonin every night?

CBD appears safe for nightly, long-term use based on current research. Melatonin is generally recommended for short-term use (2-4 weeks), though low doses (0.5-1mg) may be appropriate longer-term for older adults. Consult a healthcare provider for personalised guidance, especially if you take other medications.

### How much CBD should I take for sleep?

Studies have used 25-300mg for sleep-related benefits, but most people find 25-75mg effective. Start with 25mg taken 1 hour before bed. Give it 2-4 weeks of consistent use before increasing. Use our [dosage calculator](/tools/dosage-calculator) for personalised recommendations based on your weight and goals.

### Will melatonin make me dependent?

No. Melatonin isn't addictive and doesn't create physical dependence. However, *psychological* dependence is possible—feeling you "can't sleep without it." To avoid this, use melatonin situationally rather than nightly, and keep doses at 1mg or less.

### Which has fewer side effects?

Both have mild side effect profiles. CBD's most common effects are dry mouth and mild drowsiness. Melatonin's main issue is morning grogginess, affecting 15-20% of users at higher doses. If you've experienced melatonin hangovers, you'll likely tolerate CBD better.

### Can I take these with prescription sleep medication?

Both CBD and melatonin can interact with prescription sleep aids. CBD in particular affects how your liver metabolises many drugs, potentially increasing their effects. **Always consult your doctor** before combining any sleep supplements with prescription medications. Check [potential CBD interactions](/tools/interactions).

---

## Conclusion

CBD and melatonin are both valuable sleep aids, but they solve different problems:

**Choose melatonin** for circadian rhythm issues—jet lag, shift work, delayed sleep phase, or age-related melatonin decline. It works immediately but is best used short-term.

**Choose CBD** for sleep problems rooted in anxiety, stress, or pain. It requires consistent use for 2-4 weeks but is safer for long-term management and addresses multiple underlying causes.

**Consider combining both** for comprehensive support—melatonin provides the "time to sleep" signal while CBD removes barriers to relaxation. Start with CBD alone, then add low-dose melatonin if needed.

Whatever you choose, prioritise quality products, start with low doses, and give your approach adequate time before adjusting.
