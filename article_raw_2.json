Third-Party Testing\n\n**Essential:**\n- Independent [lab testing](/glossary/lab-testing)\n- COAs (Certificates of Analysis) available\n- Batch-specific results\n- Tests for potency and contaminants\n\n**Red flag:** No testing or self-testing only\n\n### 2. Transparency\n\n**Look for:**\n- [Hemp](/glossary/hemp) source disclosed\n- Extraction method explained\n- Company information clear\n- Customer service accessible\n\n**Red flag:** Vague about operations\n\n### 3.

Reputation\n\n**Research:**\n- Customer reviews (multiple sources)\n- Industry recognition\n- Years in business\n- How they handle complaints\n\n**Red flag:** Many negative reviews or no track record\n\n---\n\n## Quality Indicators\n\n### Hemp Source\n\n**Better options:**\n- Organic hemp\n- US/EU grown (known regulations)\n- Single-source or traceable\n- Pesticide-free\n\n### Extraction Method\n\n**Preferred:**\n- CO2 extraction (cleanest)\n- Ethanol extraction (acceptable)\n- Avoid unknown methods\n- Should be disclosed\n\n### Product Range\n\n**Good signs:**\n- Appropriate variety\n- Different strengths\n- Clear formulations\n- Not claiming to cure everything\n\n---\n\n## Testing to Verify\n\n### What COAs Should Show\n\n**Potency:**\n- CBD content accurate\n- [THC](/glossary/thc) content verified\n- Other [cannabinoids](/glossary/cannabinoid) (if full-spectrum)\n\n**Safety:**\n- Heavy metals\n- Pesticides\n- Residual solvents\n- Microbial contaminants\n\n### How to Read COAs\n\nSteps:\n1. Find on company website\n2. Match batch number to product\n3. Verify CBD matches label\n4. Check THC is compliant\n5.

Compare to alternatives\n\n### Questions to Ask\n\n- Where is your hemp sourced?\n- What extraction method?\n- Can I see third-party test results?\n- What's your return policy?\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. **[Third-party testing](/glossary/third-party-testing)** is non-negotiable\n2. **Transparency** about sourcing and methods\n3. **Verify claims** match reality\n4. **Check reputation** through multiple sources\n5. **Avoid too-cheap** products\n6. **COAs should be accessible**\n\n---\n\n## My Take\n\nThe CBD market has matured, and quality brands have emerged. But there are still poor products out there. Taking a few minutes to verify testing and research a brand saves you money and ensures you get something that actually works.\n\nThe best brands are transparent because they have nothing to hide. If a company makes it hard to find testing results or is vague about their operations, that's a red flag.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n## Related Studies\n\nResearch related to this topic:\n\n- [Safety Assessment: Cannabidiol (CBD) Isolate as a Novel Food for Use in a Range ... (2024)](/research/study/safety-assessment-cannabidiol-cbd-isolate-as-a-novel-food-fo-2024-cf72e9) - Human Trial\n\n[Browse all CBD research →](/research)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### How much should I expect to pay for quality CBD products?\n\nQuality CBD typically costs $0.05-$0.15 per milligram of CBD. A 1000mg [tincture](/glossary/tincture) should range from $50-$150, while cheaper options under $30 often indicate lower quality or inaccurate labeling. Premium organic brands with extensive testing may cost more, but avoid products that seem too cheap as they likely cut corners on quality or potency.\n\n### Can I trust CBD brands that sell on Amazon or gas stations?\n\nAmazon prohibits CBD sales, so products marketed as \"CBD\" there are likely hemp seed oil or mislabeled. Gas station CBD products often lack proper testing and quality control. Stick to brands that sell through their own websites or licensed dispensaries where you can verify third-party lab results and company credentials.\n\n### How recent should a CBD brand's lab test results be?\n\nLab results should be no more than 12 months old, with 6 months being ideal for optimal accuracy. Each product batch should have its own [Certificate of Analysis](/glossary/certificate-of-analysis) (COA) that you can access by scanning a QR code or entering a batch number on the company's website.\n\n### What certifications should legitimate CBD brands have?\n\nLook for ISO 9001 certification for quality management, organic certifications like USDA Organic, and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) compliance. While not required, brands with these certifications demonstrate commitment to quality standards. Avoid companies making medical claims or displaying fake [FDA](/glossary/fda) approval badges.\n\n### How can I verify if a CBD brand's customer reviews are genuine?\n\nCheck multiple review platforms beyond the brand's website, including Google Reviews, Trustpilot, and Reddit discussions. Genuine reviews mention specific products, effects experienced, and often include minor criticisms. Be suspicious of brands with only 5-star reviews or reviews that sound overly promotional and lack specific details.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n- [CBD Quality Guide](/knowledge/cbd-quality-guide)\n- [How to Read Lab Reports](/knowledge/how-to-read-cbd-lab-reports)\n- [CBD Buying Mistakes](/knowledge/cbd-buying-mistakes)\n\n---\n\n*This article is for educational purposes only.*\n\n---\n\n**Medical Disclaimer:** This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.
