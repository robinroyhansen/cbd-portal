This allows you to start with lower doses and increase as needed. Higher strengths suit experienced users or those needing higher doses, while lower strengths may be too weak for many goals.\n\n---\n\n## Key Numbers: CBD Oil Strength Guidelines\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Beginner recommended strength | 500-1000mg per 30ml bottle |\n| Cost difference (high vs low strength) | £0.08/mg vs £0.05/mg |\n| Common daily dose range | 10-100mg+ |\n| Typical gummy concentration | 10-25mg per gummy |\n| Standard bottle sizes | 10ml, 30ml, 50ml |\n\nThese numbers reflect common CBD oil strengths and dosing ranges, with medium-strength products (1000mg/30ml) offering the best balance of flexibility and value for most users.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Medium strength (500-1000mg) best for beginners\n- Calculate cost per mg, not just bottle price\n- Higher strength = more value usually\n- Match strength to expected dose\n- Don't buy lowest strength to \"start low\"\n\n---\n\n## Understanding CBD Strengths\n\n### How It's Measured\n\n**Bottle Labelling:**\n- Total mg in bottle (e.g., 1000mg)\n- Concentration (e.g., 3.3%)\n- Per-ml amount (e.g., 33mg/ml)\n\n### Common Bottle Sizes\n\n| Bottle Size | Common Strengths |\n|-------------|------------------|\n| 10ml | 250-1000mg |\n| 30ml | 500-3000mg |\n| 50ml | 1000-5000mg |\n\n---\n\n## Strength Recommendations\n\n### By Experience Level\n\n| Level | Recommended Strength |\n|-------|---------------------|\n| Beginner | 500-1000mg (30ml) |\n| Intermediate | 1000-1500mg (30ml) |\n| Experienced | 1500-3000mg (30ml) |\n\n### By Daily Dose Needs\n\n| Daily Dose | Minimum Bottle Strength |\n|------------|------------------------|\n| 10-20mg | 300-500mg |\n| 25-50mg | 500-1000mg |\n| 50-100mg | 1000-2000mg |\n| 100mg+ | 2000mg+ |\n\n---\n\n## The Value Calculation\n\n### Cost Per mg\n\n**How to Calculate:**\nBottle Price ÷ Total mg = Cost per mg\n\n**Example:**\n- 500mg bottle: £40 = £0.08/mg\n- 1000mg bottle: £60 = £0.06/mg\n- 2000mg bottle: £100 = £0.05/mg\n\n### Higher Strength = Better Value\n\n- Price doesn't scale linearly\n- Larger/stronger usually cheaper per mg\n- Worth buying up if you know your dose\n- But don't overbuy if testing\n\n---\n\n## Common Mistake: Starting Too Low\n\n### Why 250mg Is Often Wrong\n\n**Problem:**\n- Very dilute product\n- Need many drops for effect\n- Runs out quickly\n- Poor value\n\n**Exception:**\n- Children (with medical guidance)\n- Extremely sensitive individuals\n- Very low doses needed\n\n### Better Approach\n\nStart with medium strength, use fewer drops.\n\n---\n\n## Matching Strength to Method\n\n### Oil/Tincture\n\n- All strengths available\n- Medium-high best value\n- Easy to dose precisely\n\n### Gummies\n\n- Fixed doses per gummy\n- Choose based on dose needs\n- 10-25mg/gummy common\n\n### Capsules\n\n- Fixed doses\n- Match to your needs\n- 10-50mg/capsule typical\n\n---\n\n## If You're Unsure\n\n### Safe Starting Strategy\n\n1. **Buy 1000mg (30ml)** — Good middle ground\n2. **Start with half dropper** — About 15mg\n3. **Adjust based on response**\n4. **Know for next purchase**\n\n### First Purchase Tips\n\n- Don't commit to huge bottle\n- Medium strength offers flexibility\n- Can always buy stronger next time\n- Track what works\n\n---\n\n## Upgrading Strength\n\n### When to Go Stronger\n\n- Found your dose, using lots of oil\n- Higher concentration more practical\n- Better value per mg\n- Fewer drops needed\n\n### Benefits of Higher Strength\n\n- More convenient dosing\n- Usually better value\n- Less frequent purchases\n- Less carrier oil consumed\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference Guide\n\n### For Common Goals\n\n| Goal | Suggested Strength |\n|------|-------------------|\n| Trying CBD first time | 500-1000mg |\n| Sleep support | 1000mg+ |\n| Stress/anxiety | 1000-1500mg |\n| Pain management | 1500mg+ |\n| General wellness | 500-1000mg |\n\n---\n\n## My Take\n\nFor most people, a 1000mg bottle (30ml) is the sweet spot—strong enough to be effective and economical, but not so concentrated that you're committed to high doses. Calculate the cost per mg rather than looking at bottle prices. If you know you need higher doses, buying stronger saves money.\n\n---\n\n## Related Articles\n\n- [How Much CBD Oil Should I Take?](/knowledge/how-much-cbd-oil-should-i-take)\n- [CBD Dosing Guide](/knowledge/cbd-dosing-guide)\n- [CBD Oil Strength Guide](/knowledge/cbd-oil-strength-guide)\n\n---\n\n*This article is for educational purposes only.*\n---\n\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Can I mix different CBD oil strengths together?\n\nMixing different strengths is safe and can help you create a custom concentration. For example, combining equal parts of 500mg and 1500mg oils gives you approximately 1000mg strength. This approach works well when transitioning between strengths or when you need a specific concentration not available commercially.\n\n### How long does a 1000mg CBD oil bottle typically last?\n\nA 30ml bottle with 1000mg CBD lasts 15-60 days depending on your daily dose. At 25mg daily, it lasts about 40 days. At 50mg daily, expect around 20 days. Higher strength bottles often provide better value for consistent users since you use fewer drops per dose.\n\n### Should I buy a lower strength CBD oil if I'm sensitive to supplements?\n\nStrength doesn't determine sensitivity - the total amount you take does. A sensitive person can use high-strength oil by taking fewer drops. Medium-strength oils (500-1000mg) actually offer better control for sensitive users since you can more easily adjust your dose up or down.\n\n### Is there a difference in quality between high and low strength CBD oils?\n\nStrength doesn't indicate quality - both high and low concentrations can be equally pure and effective. However, higher strength oils often cost more to produce, so reputable brands typically use their best extraction methods for premium, high-concentration products. Always check third-party lab results regardless of strength.\n\n### What happens if I accidentally buy CBD oil that's too strong for me?\n\nSimply use fewer drops to achieve your desired dose. A 2000mg oil requiring 3-4 drops gives the same effect as a 1000mg oil requiring 6-8 drops. You can also dilute strong CBD oil with carrier oil (like MCT oil) to create a lower concentration if preferred.\n\n## Related Studies\n\nResearch related to this topic:\n\n- [What has research over the past two decades revealed about the adverse health ef...
