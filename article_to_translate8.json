CBD offers a way to reduce anxiety without the impairment and consequences of alcohol.\n\nBut CBD helps you be a calmer version of yourself, not someone different. If you fundamentally don't enjoy social events, CBD will make them more bearable, not enjoyable. That's valuable—we often have to attend things we'd rather skip. CBD just makes the experience less unpleasant.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n## Related Studies\n\nResearch related to this topic:\n\n- [Neural basis of anxiolytic effects of cannabidiol (CBD) in generalized social an...

If you choose to drink, start with lower amounts of both and monitor how you feel. Many people find CBD alone provides the social confidence they seek without needing alcohol.\n\n### How long does CBD last during a long party or wedding?\n\nCBD effects typically last 4-6 hours, so for events longer than this, you may need to redose. Take your second dose when you notice the calming effects beginning to fade, usually around the 4-hour mark. Keep a small amount with you for longer celebrations like all-day weddings or festivals.\n\n### Will CBD make me too sleepy or quiet at social gatherings?\n\nAt moderate social doses (15-25mg), CBD shouldn't make you sleepy or withdrawn—it typically reduces anxiety while keeping you alert and engaged. Higher doses (50mg+) are more likely to cause drowsiness. Start with lower amounts for daytime or active social events, reserving higher doses for evening wind-down situations.\n\n### What's the difference between using CBD gummies versus tinctures for parties?\n\nGummies are more discreet and easier to dose at events but take 1-2 hours to work, requiring advance planning. Tinctures work faster (30-60 minutes) and allow precise dosing adjustments, but aren't as convenient to use publicly. For spontaneous social situations, keeping a [tincture](/glossary/tincture) handy gives you more flexibility.\n\n### Should I tell people I'm taking CBD at social events?\n\nThis depends on your comfort level and the crowd, but there's no medical requirement to disclose CBD use. Since CBD doesn't impair judgment or coordination like alcohol, it's generally a personal choice. If asked directly or if you're in a conservative setting, you might simply mention you're taking a natural supplement for relaxation.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n- [CBD for Social Anxiety](/conditions/cbd-and-social-anxiety)\n- [CBD for Introverts](/knowledge/cbd-for-introverts)\n- [CBD and Alcohol](/knowledge/cbd-and-alcohol)\n\n---\n\n*This article is for educational purposes only.
