# CBD and Cat Aggression & Behavior: What the Research Shows

Does CBD help with cat aggression & behavior? Based on the 2 studies I've reviewed, I have to be direct: there's very little research specifically on CBD and cat aggression & behavior. The few studies that exist are preliminary, and I can't draw meaningful conclusions from such limited data.

## What the Research Shows

### The Best Evidence (Clinical Trials)

The strongest evidence comes from 2 human studies, including 0 randomized controlled trials. 

A [2025 study](/research/study/sativex-nabiximols-for-the-treatment-of-agitation-aggression-2025-1e7cf7) found that researchers tested a cbd-based drug called sativex to see if it could help reduce agitation and aggression in people with [alzheimer's](/conditions/alzheimers) disease living in nursing homes in the uk. in this carefully desig...

A [2007 study](/research/study/testing-the-self-medication-hypothesis-of-[depression](/conditions/depression)-and-agg-2007-0f3fc6) found that here is a 99-word plain-language summary of the study:

this study looked at why people with depression or aggression problems use cannabis and how it affects them.

### What Reviews Conclude

No systematic reviews have been published specifically on CBD and cat aggression & behavior. This gap in the literature makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.

### Supporting Evidence

Limited preclinical research exists for this condition. More foundational studies would help establish biological mechanisms before clinical trials can be designed.

## Studies Worth Knowing

### Sativex (nabiximols) for the treatment of Agitation & Aggression in Alzheimer's ... (2025)

Researchers tested a CBD-based drug called Sativex to see if it could help reduce agitation and aggression in people with Alzheimer's disease living in nursing homes in the UK. In this carefully designed study, neither the patients nor the doctors knew who got the real drug or a fake one. The results showed that the people who took Sativex had noticeable improvements in their agitation and aggression compared to those who took the placebo. This suggests that Sativex could be a helpful treatment option for managing these challenging Alzheimer's symptoms, but more research is still needed.

### Testing the self-medication hypothesis of depression and aggression in cannabis-... (2007)

Here is a 99-word plain-language summary of the study:

This study looked at why people with depression or aggression problems use cannabis and how it affects them.

The researchers studied 119 people who were dependent on cannabis. They compared those with a history of depression or aggression issues to those without.

They found that people with depression did not use cannabis to self-medicate. In fact, when high, they felt more depressed, anxious and paranoid, rather than experiencing relief.

However, people with aggression problems did seem to use cannabis to try to control their anger. When intoxicated, they were more likely to feel aggressive.

The results suggest cannabis may be used to self-medicate aggression, but not depression.

## How CBD Might Help with Cat Aggression & Behavior

CBD interacts with the body's [endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) (ECS), which plays a role in regulating various physiological processes. While the exact mechanisms for cat aggression & behavior are still being studied, researchers believe CBD may work through several pathways:

- **CB1 and CB2 receptors:** CBD has low affinity for these receptors but can modulate their activity
- **[Serotonin](/conditions/serotonin) receptors (5-HT1A):** May influence [mood](/conditions/mood) and perception
- **TRPV1 receptors:** Involved in [pain](/conditions/pain) perception and [inflammation](/conditions/inflammation)

These mechanisms are still being investigated, and we don't fully understand how they relate to cat aggression & behavior specifically.

## My Take

Having reviewed 2 studies on CBD and cat aggression & behavior — and worked in the CBD industry for over 12 years — here's my honest assessment:

I have to be direct: there's almost no research on CBD for cat aggression & behavior. I can't recommend it based on evidence because the evidence doesn't exist yet. Some people try it based on CBD's general effects, but you'd be experimenting, not following science.

What I'm watching for: Any foundational research that could justify clinical studies.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can CBD cure cat aggression & behavior?

No. CBD is not a cure for cat aggression & behavior. Research suggests it may help manage symptoms in some cases, but it should complement — not replace — conventional treatment. Always consult your doctor before making changes to your healthcare routine.

### How much CBD should I take for cat aggression & behavior?

Clinical studies have used doses ranging widely, from 25mg to 600mg daily. There's no "standard" dose, and individual responses vary. Start low (10-25mg) and increase gradually while monitoring effects. Use our [dosage calculator](/tools/dosage-calculator) as a starting point.

### How long does CBD take to work for cat aggression & behavior?

This depends on the delivery method and individual factors. Sublingual oils may take 15-45 minutes, while capsules can take 1-2 hours. Some studies suggest benefits build over several weeks of consistent use.

### Can I take CBD with my current medications?

CBD can interact with certain medications by affecting liver enzymes (particularly CYP450). If you're taking any medications, especially [blood thinners](/conditions/blood-thinners), anti-seizure drugs, or [antidepressants](/conditions/antidepressants), consult your doctor before using CBD.

### What type of CBD is best for cat aggression & behavior?

Most studies use CBD isolate or full-spectrum extracts. Some researchers suggest full-spectrum products may have enhanced effects due to the "entourage effect," but this is still debated. Choose quality products from reputable sources with third-party testing.
