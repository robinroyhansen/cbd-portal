## Quick Summary

Quality CBD requires: **third-party [lab testing](/glossary/lab-testing), clear labeling, reputable brand, appropriate pricing, and proper extraction.** Avoid products without lab reports, unrealistic claims, suspiciously low prices, or unclear sourcing. The unregulated market means buyer diligence is essential.

---

## Key Numbers: CBD Product Quality

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| CBD content accuracy | Often less than labeled |
| Lab report validity period | Within 12 months |
| CBD isolate purity | 99%+ CBD only |
| Typical 30ml oil price range | $30-60 |

These statistics highlight the importance of third-party testing and proper due diligence when purchasing CBD products in an unregulated market.

## Why Quality Matters

### The Market Reality

| Issue | Frequency |
|-------|-----------|
| Products with less CBD than labeled | Common |
| Undisclosed [THC](/glossary/thc) | Occurs |
| Contaminants (pesticides, metals) | Found |
| No or fake lab reports | Exists |
| Mislabeled products | Common |

### Consequences of Poor Quality

- No therapeutic benefit
- Unexpected THC (drug tests)
- Potential health risks (contaminants)
- Wasted money
- Lost trust in CBD

---

## The Essential Checklist

### Must-Haves

✓ **Third-party lab testing (COA)**
✓ **Clear CBD content labeling**
✓ **Company contact information**
✓ **Proper packaging**
✓ **Reasonable pricing**

### Red Flags

✗ No lab reports available
✗ Unrealistic health claims
✗ Suspiciously cheap
✗ Unknown company
✗ Missing information

---

## Third-Party Lab Testing

### Why It's Non-Negotiable

Lab reports (COA) verify:
- Actual CBD content
- THC levels
- Absence of contaminants
- Product safety

### What to Look For

**On the lab report:**
- Third-party lab name (not in-house)
- Recent date (within 12 months)
- Batch number matching your product
- Cannabinoid profile (CBD content)
- Contaminant testing results

### How to Find Lab Reports

- QR code on product
- Company website
- Request via email
- If hard to find → red flag

---

## Understanding Labels

### What Should Be On Label

| Information | Why It Matters |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Total CBD (mg)** | Know what you're getting |
| **CBD per serving** | Calculate doses |
| **Ingredients** | Allergens, carrier oils |
| **Batch/lot number** | Matches lab report |
| **Company info** | Accountability |
| **Expiration date** | Freshness |

### Label Math

Example:
- Bottle: 1000mg CBD / 30ml
- Per ml: 33mg CBD
- Per dropper (1ml): 33mg
- Per half dropper: ~16.5mg

Verify this matches lab reports.

## Types of CBD

### Which to Choose

| Type | Contains | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| **[Full-Spectrum](/glossary/full-spectrum)** | CBD + [cannabinoids](/glossary/cannabinoid) + THC (trace) | Maximum potential benefits |
| **[Broad-Spectrum](/glossary/broad-spectrum)** | CBD + cannabinoids, no THC | [Drug testing](/conditions/drug-testing) concerns |
| **Isolate** | Pure CBD only | THC zero tolerance |

### Verify the Type

- Full-spectrum should show multiple cannabinoids on [COA](/glossary/certificate-of-analysis)
- Broad-spectrum should show ND (not detected) for THC
- Isolate should be 99%+ CBD only

---

## Extraction Methods

### Quality Extraction

| Method | Quality | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **CO2 extraction** | Best | Clean, efficient, preserves cannabinoids |
| **Ethanol** | Good | Common, effective |
| **Hydrocarbon** | Variable | Can be good with proper purging |
| **Olive oil** | Basic | Traditional, less efficient |

### What to Look For

- CO2 or ethanol preferred
- Avoid unknown methods
- Residual solvent testing on COA

---

## Hemp Source

### What Matters

**Good indicators:**
- US, EU, or Canadian grown (regulated)
- Organic or organically grown
- Reputable farms
- Traceable sourcing

**Concerns:**
- Unknown origin
- Countries with less regulation
- No sourcing information

### Why Sourcing Matters

[Hemp](/glossary/hemp) absorbs from soil:
- Heavy metals
- Pesticides
- Contaminants

Quality hemp = cleaner products

---

## Pricing Reality

### What Quality CBD Costs

| Product | Typical Quality Range |
|---------|----------------------|
| **30ml oil (500-1000mg)** | $30-60 |
| **30ml oil (1500-3000mg)** | $60-120 |
| **[Capsules](/glossary/capsules) (30ct, 25mg)** | $40-80 |
| **Gummies (30ct, 10-25mg)** | $30-60 |

### Price Red Flags

**Too cheap:**
- May contain less CBD than labeled
- May have contaminants
- May be from poor sources
- If it seems too good to be true...

**Overpriced:**
- Celebrity branding
- Excessive marketing claims
- Doesn't mean better quality

---

## Brand Evaluation

### How to Assess a Brand

| Factor | What to Check |
|--------|---------------|
| **Reputation** | Reviews, mentions, longevity |
| **Transparency** | Lab reports, sourcing info |
| **Customer service** | Responsive, helpful |
| **Website** | Professional, informative |
| **Claims** | Realistic vs. over-hyped |

### Research Steps

1. Search "[brand name] review"
2. Check independent review sites

4. Contact customer service with questions
5. Trust your overall impression

|----------|---------------------|
| **Cures all claims** | Illegal, unrealistic |
| **No lab reports** | Can't verify anything |
| **MLM/Network marketing** | Usually overpriced, questionable |

## My Take

Buying quality CBD requires more diligence than buying most supplements because the market is poorly regulated. But it's not complicated once you know what to look for.

The single most important thing: lab reports. If a company won't provide [third-party testing](/glossary/third-party-testing), don't buy from them. Period. It takes 5 minutes to check, and it protects you from the many questionable products out there.

Beyond that, buy from companies that are transparent about their sourcing, have reasonable prices (not suspiciously cheap), and don't make outlandish claims. Quality CBD brands want you to have good experiences because they want repeat customers.

If you're new, start with a well-reviewed brand even if it costs a bit more. Once you know what good CBD feels like, you can experiment with other options.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long do quality CBD products typically last before expiring?

Most quality CBD products have a shelf life of 12-24 months when stored properly in a cool, dark place. [CBD oil](/glossary/cbd-oil) and tinctures generally last 12-18 months, while gummies and [edibles](/glossary/edibles) may have shorter expiration dates due to other ingredients. Always check the expiration date on packaging and look for products with clear date labeling.

### Can I trust CBD products sold at gas stations or convenience stores?

Gas station and convenience store CBD products are generally not recommended as they often lack proper lab testing, quality control, and regulatory oversight. These venues typically prioritize profit margins over product quality, leading to inconsistent potency and potential contamination risks. Purchase from licensed dispensaries, reputable online retailers, or specialized CBD stores instead.

### What's the difference between full-spectrum, broad-spectrum, and CBD isolate products?

Full-spectrum contains all [cannabis](/glossary/cannabis) compounds including up to 0.3% THC, broad-spectrum contains multiple cannabinoids but no THC, and [CBD isolate](/glossary/cbd-isolate) is pure CBD only. Full-spectrum may provide enhanced effects through the "[entourage effect](/glossary/entourage-effect)" but could show on drug tests, while isolate offers predictable dosing without other compounds.

### How much should I expect to pay for quality CBD products?

Quality CBD typically costs $0.05-$0.20 per milligram of CBD, depending on product type and brand reputation. A 30ml bottle with 1000mg CBD should range from $50-$200, with tinctures generally being more affordable than gummies or [topicals](/glossary/topicals). Prices significantly below this range often indicate lower quality or mislabeled products.

### Do I need a prescription or medical card to buy quality CBD products?

Hemp-derived CBD products containing less than 0.3% THC are federally legal and don't require prescriptions or medical cards in most states. However, state laws vary, and some states have additional restrictions or require purchases through licensed dispensaries. Always verify your local laws before purchasing, as regulations continue to evolve.
