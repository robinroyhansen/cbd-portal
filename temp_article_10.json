Only licensed agricultural producers can legally grow hemp varieties listed in the EU Common Catalogue. Personal cultivation could result in legal issues regardless of THC content.\n\n### What happens if I'm caught with high-THC CBD products in Italy?\n\nPossession of CBD products exceeding the 0.3% THC limit may be treated as possession of cannabis, potentially resulting in administrative sanctions including license suspension and fines up to €1,032. Criminal charges are possible for larger quantities or suspected distribution.\n\n### Do Italian customs check CBD products when ordering from other EU countries?\n\nWhile EU internal borders generally allow free movement of compliant CBD products, Italian customs may conduct random checks. Products must have proper documentation, EU-compliant labeling, and THC levels below legal limits. Non-compliant products will be seized regardless of their legal status in the origin country.\n\n### Are CBD edibles and oils treated differently under Italian law?\n\nCBD oils and edibles face different regulatory pathways in Italy. Oils are often classified as food supplements requiring Novel Food authorization, while edibles may need specific food safety approvals. Both must contain less than 0.3% THC, but edibles face stricter manufacturing and labeling requirements under Italian food law.\n\n### Can Italian employers fire me for using legal CBD products?\n\nItalian workplace drug policies vary by employer and industry sector. While legal CBD use shouldn't cause positive drug tests, full-spectrum products may contain trace THC that could potentially trigger workplace testing. Safety-sensitive jobs like transportation or healthcare may have stricter policies regardless of CBD's legal status.\n\n## Related Studies\n\nResearch related to this topic:\n\n- [Cannabis Use for Endometriosis: Clinical and Legal Challenges in Australia and N...
