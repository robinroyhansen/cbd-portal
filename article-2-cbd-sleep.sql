  'Explore what 2024-2025 clinical trials reveal about CBD for sleep and insomnia, including mechanisms, effective dosages, and evidence-based recommendations.',
  'Sleep difficulties affect millions worldwide, with approximately 30% of adults experiencing symptoms of insomnia at any given time. As interest in natural sleep aids continues to grow, cannabidiol (CBD) has emerged as a popular option for those seeking alternatives to traditional sleep medications. But what does the scientific evidence actually tell us about CBD''s effectiveness for sleep disorders?

Whilst anecdotal reports of CBD improving sleep are widespread, the clinical evidence base is still developing. Recent studies from 2024 and 2025 have begun to provide more rigorous data, though researchers emphasise the need for larger, longer-term trials. Understanding both the promise and limitations of current research is essential for anyone considering CBD as a sleep aid.

The relationship between cannabinoids and sleep is complex, involving the endocannabinoid system''s interaction with circadian rhythms, neurotransmitter systems, and sleep architecture. This article examines what we currently know from clinical trials, how CBD may influence sleep mechanisms, and what the evidence suggests about dosing and safety.

## How CBD May Influence Sleep

The endocannabinoid system plays a significant role in regulating sleep-wake cycles. Research published in *Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience* demonstrates that endocannabinoids display circadian fluctuations in healthy humans, with anandamide (AEA) levels highest upon waking and lowest just before sleep onset. This natural rhythm can be disrupted by sleep disturbances, suggesting the endocannabinoid system is intimately involved in sleep regulation.

CBD interacts with this system through multiple pathways. Unlike THC, which binds directly to CB1 receptors, CBD modulates endocannabinoid signalling through various receptor sites, including serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, which are implicated in anxiety and sleep regulation. A 2024 review in *International Journal of Molecular Sciences* notes that CBD shows promise in improving sleep quality without the psychoactive effects associated with THC.

The suprachiasmatic nucleus, a hypothalamic region critical for controlling circadian rhythm, releases endocannabinoids that activate intracellular astrocyte signalling. This influences circadian clock timing and, by extension, sleep-wake patterns. CBD may act as a chronobiotic compound—a substance that can help entrain biological rhythms and facilitate healthy sleep periods.

Interestingly, CBD''s effects on sleep appear to be dose-dependent. Studies suggest that higher doses (around 600 mg) may induce sedative effects in healthy volunteers, whilst lower doses might actually increase alertness. This biphasic response highlights the importance of appropriate dosing and suggests that CBD''s sleep-promoting effects are not simply due to general sedation.

Additionally, CBD may address underlying causes of poor sleep rather than directly inducing drowsiness. By reducing anxiety through 5-HT1A receptor activation and potentially modulating pain perception through various mechanisms, CBD may improve sleep quality by alleviating conditions that interfere with rest.

## What the Research Shows

### Recent Clinical Trials (2024-2025)

The most robust recent evidence comes from a randomised controlled pilot trial published in May 2024 in the *Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine*. This study evaluated 150 mg of nightly CBD dosing in 30 participants with moderate to severe primary insomnia (15 receiving CBD, 15 receiving placebo). This represented the first study to explore the maximum dose of over-the-counter CBD available in Australia at the time.

The results were mixed. Whilst some participants reported subjective improvements in sleep quality, the trial did not demonstrate statistically significant improvements in objective sleep measures compared to placebo. The researchers noted considerable individual variation in response, with some participants experiencing notable benefits whilst others saw minimal change.

A follow-up study published in *Psychopharmacology* in 2024 examined the daytime neurocognitive performance of the same participants. Importantly, the study found that 150 mg of nightly CBD did not impair next-day cognitive function, addressing safety concerns about potential residual effects that might affect driving or workplace performance.

In early 2025, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised crossover study evaluated a CBD-terpene formulation in 125 participants with insomnia. This trial, published in the *Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine*, administered 300 mg of CBD combined with terpenes for at least four days per week over four weeks. The study examined sleep physiology more comprehensively than previous trials, though final results are still being analysed.

Another 2025 study, published in *PMC*, examined a cannabinoid supplement containing 3 mg THC, 6 mg cannabinol (CBN), 10 mg CBD, and 90 mg of a proprietary terpene blend in 20 adults with subthreshold insomnia. Compared to placebo, the cannabinoid formulation was associated with significant improvements from baseline in sleep latency (time to fall asleep), sleep duration, and global sleep quality. However, because this formulation contained multiple cannabinoids, isolating CBD''s specific contribution is challenging.

### Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses

A comprehensive review published in December 2024 identified 21 recent studies examining cannabinoids for various sleep disorders, including insomnia, subjective sleep impairment, obstructive sleep apnoea, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, and restless legs syndrome. The reviewers concluded that whilst cannabinoids are being widely used for sleep disorders, "the evidence base does not match widespread use," emphasising the need for adequately funded, well-designed clinical trials with longer treatment durations and larger sample sizes.

A 2022 systematic review published in *PubMed* specifically examining CBD for insomnia management found limited high-quality evidence, with most studies being small pilot trials or observational studies. The review called for randomised controlled trials with standardised CBD formulations and validated sleep outcome measures.

### Ongoing Research

Avecho Biotechnology commenced patient recruitment in 2024 for a pivotal Phase III clinical trial testing an oral CBD soft-gel capsule for insomnia. This study aims to recruit 519 patients across Australian sites, making it the largest insomnia study of its kind testing CBD. Results from this trial, expected in the coming years, may provide more definitive evidence about CBD''s efficacy for sleep disorders.

## Dosage Considerations

The limited clinical trial data makes evidence-based dosage recommendations challenging. The studies conducted to date have used widely varying doses:

**Low to moderate doses (10-25 mg):** Some observational studies and case reports have used doses in this range, though controlled trial data is lacking. Anecdotal reports suggest benefits for some individuals, but lower doses may potentially increase alertness rather than promote sleep.

**Moderate to high doses (150-300 mg):** Recent clinical trials have focused on this range. The 2024 Australian trial used 150 mg nightly, whilst the 2025 CBD-terpene study used 300 mg. These doses are considerably higher than typical commercial CBD products recommend.

**Very high doses (600+ mg):** Research in healthy volunteers has shown sedative effects at 600 mg, but this dose level has not been systematically studied in people with insomnia.

The biphasic nature of CBD''s effects—where different doses may produce opposite effects—complicates dosage guidance. Individual factors including body weight, metabolism, the severity of sleep disturbance, and underlying causes of poor sleep likely influence optimal dosing.

Most researchers suggest starting with lower doses and gradually increasing whilst monitoring effects. Consistency of timing is also important; taking CBD at the same time each evening may help with circadian entrainment.

It''s worth noting that combination formulations containing CBD alongside other cannabinoids (such as CBN) or terpenes may produce different effects than CBD alone, potentially allowing for lower effective doses through synergistic interactions—an effect sometimes called the "entourage effect."

## Safety and Side Effects

CBD is generally well-tolerated, with a favourable safety profile compared to many conventional sleep medications. The 2024 studies examining 150 mg nightly dosing found no significant adverse events and, importantly, no next-day cognitive impairment.

Common side effects reported in clinical trials include:

**Gastrointestinal effects:** Mild diarrhoea or changes in appetite have been reported in some studies, though these effects are typically mild.

**Fatigue:** Whilst this might be desirable for sleep, some individuals report daytime tiredness, particularly at higher doses.

**Changes in weight or appetite:** Some clinical trials of CBD (primarily in epilepsy research using very high doses) have noted these effects.

**Drug interactions:** CBD inhibits certain cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, which metabolise many common medications. This can increase blood levels of some drugs, including certain antidepressants, blood thinners, and immunosuppressants.

Individuals taking prescription medications should consult a healthcare provider before using CBD, as dose adjustments may be necessary. This is particularly important for medications with narrow therapeutic windows.

Concerns about long-term effects on sleep architecture remain. Some research suggests that whilst THC may initially promote sleep, chronic use can alter sleep structure, potentially reducing REM sleep. The extent to which CBD affects sleep architecture over time requires further investigation through longer-term studies.

Quality and purity of CBD products is another important safety consideration. The lack of comprehensive regulation in many markets means that products may contain less CBD than labelled, or may be contaminated with THC, pesticides, or heavy metals. Third-party testing certificates can help verify product quality.

## Important Considerations

### CBD Is Not a Cure-All

Whilst some individuals may find CBD helpful for sleep, it should not be viewed as a universal solution for insomnia. The current evidence shows considerable individual variation in response, with some people experiencing significant benefits and others noting little to no effect.

Sleep disorders often have multiple contributing factors—stress, anxiety, pain, poor sleep hygiene, circadian rhythm disruptions, or underlying medical conditions. CBD may be most beneficial when sleep difficulties are related to conditions it can help address, such as anxiety or chronic pain, rather than as a standalone sleep aid.

### Sleep Hygiene Remains Fundamental

Evidence-based sleep hygiene practices should form the foundation of any approach to improving sleep:

- Maintaining consistent sleep and wake times
- Creating a cool, dark, quiet sleep environment
- Limiting screen time before bed
- Avoiding caffeine in the afternoon and evening
- Regular physical activity (but not close to bedtime)
- Managing stress through relaxation techniques

Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has strong evidence supporting its effectiveness and is considered a first-line treatment for chronic insomnia.

### Quality Matters

When considering CBD products, quality is paramount. Look for:

- Third-party laboratory testing certificates
- Clear labelling of CBD content
- Full-spectrum, broad-spectrum, or isolate designation
- Extraction method information
- Absence of concerning contaminants

Products from reputable manufacturers that provide transparent testing information are preferable to those making exaggerated claims without supporting evidence.

### Medical Supervision

Anyone with a diagnosed sleep disorder, underlying health conditions, or those taking prescription medications should consult a healthcare provider before using CBD. This is particularly important for individuals with:

- Sleep apnoea or other breathing-related sleep disorders
- Liver conditions (as CBD is metabolised by the liver)
- Mental health conditions
- Pregnancy or breastfeeding

## The Bottom Line

The evidence for CBD as a sleep aid is still evolving. Recent clinical trials from 2024 and 2025 have begun to provide more rigorous data, but the studies remain relatively small and short-term. A 2024 trial of 150 mg nightly CBD in people with moderate to severe insomnia showed mixed results, with considerable individual variation. Whilst some participants experienced benefits, the trial did not demonstrate statistically significant improvements in objective sleep measures compared to placebo.

The mechanisms by which CBD might improve sleep are plausible and supported by preclinical research. CBD''s interaction with the endocannabinoid system, which displays circadian fluctuations and influences sleep-wake cycles, provides a theoretical basis for its effects. Additionally, CBD''s potential to reduce anxiety and modulate pain perception may improve sleep quality indirectly by addressing underlying causes of sleep disturbance.

Dosing remains a challenge, with clinical trials using doses (150-300 mg) considerably higher than many commercial products recommend. The biphasic nature of CBD''s effects means that lower doses might not produce the same sleep-promoting effects as higher doses, though individual responses vary significantly.

Safety data is reassuring, with studies showing good tolerability and no next-day cognitive impairment at the doses studied. However, potential drug interactions and the importance of product quality should not be overlooked.

For those considering CBD for sleep, it may be worth trying under medical supervision, particularly if conventional approaches have been unsuccessful and sleep difficulties are related to anxiety or pain. However, it should be viewed as one potential tool rather than a guaranteed solution, and should complement rather than replace evidence-based sleep hygiene practices.

The field would benefit greatly from larger, longer-term randomised controlled trials examining different doses, formulations, and patient populations. The ongoing Phase III trial with 519 participants may provide more definitive answers about CBD''s role in treating insomnia.

Until more robust evidence emerges, CBD remains a promising but not yet proven option for sleep disorders. Those who choose to try it should do so with realistic expectations, attention to product quality, awareness of potential interactions, and ideally under the guidance of a healthcare provider familiar with cannabinoid therapeutics.
