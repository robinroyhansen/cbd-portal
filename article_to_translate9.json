Consider keeping a small [sublingual](/glossary/sublingual) [tincture](/glossary/tincture) nearby for faster absorption (15-20 minutes), or take a daily dose if phone anxiety is frequent to maintain baseline calm throughout the day.\n\n### What's the best CBD dosage for phone call anxiety?\n\nStart with 5-10mg about 45 minutes before planned calls to assess your response. Most people find 10-25mg effective for moderate phone anxiety, while severe cases may need 25-50mg. Begin low and adjust upward gradually, as taking too much can cause drowsiness during important conversations.\n\n### Will CBD make me sound different or sluggish during phone calls?\n\nQuality CBD at appropriate doses shouldn't affect your speech or cognitive function. It primarily reduces the physical anxiety symptoms (racing heart, sweaty palms) and worried thoughts that interfere with natural conversation. Avoid high doses that might cause drowsiness, and test your response during practice calls first.\n\n### How long does CBD's anti-anxiety effect last for multiple phone calls?\n\nCBD's calming effects typically last 4-6 hours, making it suitable for handling multiple calls throughout a work morning or afternoon. Oil tinctures tend to provide longer-lasting effects than gummies or [capsules](/glossary/capsules), which is helpful for busy days with several important calls scheduled.\n\n### Does CBD work better than other natural remedies for phone anxiety?\n\nCBD may be more effective than caffeine-based solutions (which can worsen anxiety) and offers longer-lasting effects than breathing exercises alone. Unlike some herbal remedies, CBD doesn't typically cause drowsiness at moderate doses. However, combining CBD with practice calls and gradual exposure often produces the best long-term results.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n- [CBD for Social Anxiety](/knowledge/cbd-for-social-anxiety)\n- [CBD for Interview Anxiety](/knowledge/cbd-for-interview-anxiety)\n- [CBD and Anxiety](/conditions/cbd-and-anxiety)\n\n---\n\n*This article is for educational purposes only.*\n\n---\n\n**Medical Disclaimer:** This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.
