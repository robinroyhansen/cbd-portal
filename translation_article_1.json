Based on the 116 studies I've reviewed, the research shows promise, though we need more large-scale trials. The existing studies suggest potential benefits, but I want to see additional data before drawing firm conclusions. If you're considering CBD for cardiovascular health, the research offers reasons for cautious optimism.\n\n\n## Related Articles\n\n- [CBD and Heart Health: What the Research Shows 2026](/articles/cbd-and-heart-health)\n\n---\n\n## Research Snapshot\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| **Studies Reviewed** | 116 |\n| **Human Clinical Studies** | 114 |\n| **Systematic Reviews** | 1 |\n| **Total Participants** | 43 |\n| **Research Period** | 1970-2026 |\n| **Evidence Strength** | ●●●○○ Moderate |\n\n## Key Numbers\n\n| Stat | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **116** | Total peer-reviewed studies analyzed |\n| **10%** | Studies showing positive or promising results |\n| **29** | Participants in largest study |\n| **115** | Human studies and systematic reviews |\n\n## What the Research Shows\n\n### The Best Evidence (Clinical Trials)\n\nThe strongest evidence comes from 114 human studies, including 1 randomized controlled trials. \n\nA [2009 study](/research/study/2009-the-endocannabinoid-system-bíró-2009) found that this study \"(2009). \"the endocannabinoid system of the skin in health and disease.\"\" was cited in cbd portal articles and has been imported for reference....\n\nA [2020 study](/research/study/2020-therapeutic-potential-of-baswan-2020) found that this study \"(2020). \"therapeutic potential of cannabidiol (cbd) for [skin health](/conditions/skin-health) and disorders.\"\" was cited in cbd portal articles and has been imported for reference....\n\nA [2022 study](/research/study/2022-therapeutic-potential-of-patel-2022) found that this study \"(2022). \"therapeutic potential of cannabidiol (cbd) for skin health and disorders.\"\" was cited in cbd portal articles and has been imported for reference....\n\n### What Reviews Conclude\n\n1 systematic reviews have examined the evidence on CBD and cardiovascular health. \n\nA [2025 review](/research/study/cbd-[inflammation](/conditions/inflammation)-saa-2025) This study investigates CBD's anti-inflammatory properties. Researchers are examining how cannabidiol affects immune system responses and inflammation markers.\n\n### Supporting Evidence\n\nBeyond clinical studies, 1 animal studies and 0 in-vitro (lab) studies provide supporting evidence. While these can't tell us how CBD works in humans, they help establish biological plausibility and guide future research directions.\n\n**Important context:** Animal and lab studies are early-stage research. Promising results in mice or cell cultures don't always translate to humans. I include them here for completeness, not as evidence of effectiveness.\n\n## Studies Worth Knowing\n\n### (2009). \"The endocannabinoid system of the skin in health and disease.\" (2009)\n\nThis study \"(2009). \"The endocannabinoid system of the skin in health and disease.\"\" was cited in CBD Portal articles and has been imported for reference.\n\n**Sample:** Not specified participants | **Type:** human | **Quality Score:** 70/100\n\n[View study summary](/research/study/2009-the-endocannabinoid-system-bíró-2009)\n\n### (2020). \"Therapeutic Potential of Cannabidiol (CBD) for Skin Health and Disorder...

While the exact mechanisms for cardiovascular health are still being studied, researchers believe CBD may work through several pathways:\n\n- **CB1 and CB2 receptors:** CBD has low affinity for these receptors but can modulate their activity\n- **[Serotonin](/conditions/serotonin) receptors (5-HT1A):** May influence [mood](/conditions/mood) and perception\n- **TRPV1 receptors:** Involved in [pain](/conditions/pain) perception and inflammation\n\nThese mechanisms are still being investigated, and we don't fully understand how they relate to cardiovascular health specifically.\n\n## What Dosages Have Been Studied\n\n**Important:** This is NOT medical advice. I'm sharing what researchers used in studies, not recommending doses.\n\nAcross the studies I reviewed, dosages varied widely — typically ranging from 25mg to 600mg daily, depending on the study design and specific outcomes measured. Some key patterns:\n\n- Lower doses (25-50mg) were used in initial tolerability studies\n- Moderate doses (100-300mg) appeared in many clinical trials\n- Higher doses (400-600mg+) were used in some specific contexts\n\nIf you're considering CBD, use our [dosage calculator](/tools/dosage-calculator) as a starting point, but always consult with a healthcare provider.\n\n## My Take\n\nHaving reviewed 116 studies on CBD and cardiovascular health — and worked in the CBD industry for over 12 years — here's my honest assessment:\n\nThe research is promising but not conclusive. I've seen enough positive findings to think CBD is worth considering for cardiovascular health, but I want to see larger studies before being fully confident. If you try it, keep your expectations realistic and track your results.\n\nWhat I'm watching for: More randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Can CBD cure cardiovascular health?\n\nNo. CBD is not a cure for cardiovascular health. Research suggests it may help manage symptoms in some cases, but it should complement — not replace — conventional treatment. Always consult your doctor before making changes to your healthcare routine.\n\n### How much CBD should I take for cardiovascular health?\n\nClinical studies have used doses ranging widely, from 25mg to 600mg daily. There's no \"standard\" dose, and individual responses vary. Start low (10-25mg) and increase gradually while monitoring effects. Use our [dosage calculator](/tools/dosage-calculator) as a starting point.\n\n### How long does CBD take to work for cardiovascular health?\n\nThis depends on the delivery method and individual factors. Sublingual oils may take 15-45 minutes, while capsules can take 1-2 hours. Some studies suggest benefits build over several weeks of consistent use.\n\n### Can I take CBD with my current medications?\n\nCBD can interact with certain medications by affecting liver enzymes (particularly CYP450). If you're taking any medications, especially [blood thinners](/conditions/blood-thinners), anti-seizure drugs, or [antidepressants](/conditions/antidepressants), consult your doctor before using CBD.\n\n### What type of CBD is best for cardiovascular health?\n\nMost studies use CBD isolate or full-spectrum extracts. Some researchers suggest full-spectrum products may have enhanced effects due to the \"entourage effect,\" but this is still debated. Choose quality products from reputable sources with third-party testing.\n\n## References\n\nI reviewed 116 studies for this article. Key sources:\n\n1. **Bíró T, et al** (2009).
