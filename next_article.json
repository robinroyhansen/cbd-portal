CBD oil is extracted from hemp flowers and contains [cannabidiol](/glossary/cannabidiol) (CBD). Hemp oil (hemp seed oil) is pressed from hemp seeds and contains no significant CBD. If you want the benefits of CBD, you need CBD oil—hemp seed oil is a nutritious food oil but will not provide CBD effects.\n\n---\n\n## Research Snapshot\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Studies reviewed | 88 |\n| Human clinical trials | 88 |\n| Total participants | 29+ |\n| Evidence strength | ●●●○○ Moderate |\n\n*Research on CBD and bioavailability continues to evolve. [Browse all studies](/research)*\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- **CBD oil** is extracted from hemp flowers and leaves\n- It contains CBD and other cannabinoids\n- **Hemp oil/hemp seed oil** comes from seeds only\n- Seeds contain virtually no CBD\n- Hemp seed oil is a nutritious food oil (omega fatty acids)\n- Confusing labelling causes people to buy the wrong product\n- Always check for CBD content in milligrams\n\n## Key Numbers: CBD Oil vs Hemp Oil\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| CBD content in hemp seed oil | 0mg (none/negligible) |\n| CBD oil price range | €30-100+ |\n| Hemp seed oil price range | €10-20 |\n| Author's CBD industry experience | 12+ years |\n\nThese price differences reflect the extraction complexity and CBD content, with hemp seed oil being a simple pressed oil while CBD oil requires specialized extraction from plant material.\n\n## Why This Confusion Exists\n\nThe terms \"hemp oil\" and \"CBD oil\" are often used interchangeably in marketing, which creates significant confusion. Some reasons:\n\n1. **Marketing ambiguity:** \"Hemp oil\" sounds more natural\n2. **Regulatory avoidance:** Some sellers avoid \"CBD\" in product names\n3. **Genuine confusion:** Not everyone understands the difference\n4. **Intentional deception:** Some products imply CBD content without containing it\n\nAlways look for specific CBD content (in milligrams) on the label.\n\n## What Is CBD Oil?\n\n[CBD](/glossary/cbd) oil is made by extracting cannabidiol from hemp plant material:\n\n- **Source:** Hemp flowers, leaves, and stalks\n- **Extraction methods:** CO2 extraction, ethanol extraction, oil infusion\n- **Contains:** CBD and other [cannabinoids](/glossary/phytocannabinoid), [terpenes](/glossary/terpene-profile) (in full-spectrum)\n- **Purpose:** Therapeutic benefits from CBD\n- **Label shows:** CBD content in milligrams (e.g., \"500mg CBD per bottle\")\n\n## What Is Hemp Oil (Hemp Seed Oil)?\n\n[Hemp seed oil](/glossary/hemp-seed-oil) is a culinary and cosmetic oil:\n\n- **Source:** Hemp seeds only\n- **Extraction:** Cold pressing (like olive oil)\n- **Contains:** Omega fatty acids, vitamins, protein—no CBD\n- **Purpose:** Nutritional supplement, cooking, skincare\n- **Label shows:** No CBD content (or trace/negligible amounts)\n\n## Comparison Table\n\n| Factor | CBD Oil | Hemp Seed Oil |\n|--------|---------|---------------|\n| **Source** | Flowers, leaves | Seeds only |\n| **CBD content** | Significant (labelled mg) | None/negligible |\n| **Other cannabinoids** | Yes (full-spectrum) | No |\n| **Primary use** | Therapeutic | Nutritional, cosmetic |\n| **Price** | EUR 30-100 | EUR 10-20 |\n| **Taste** | Earthy, hempy | Nutty |\n| **Legal complexity** | [Novel Food](/glossary/novel-food) regulated | Food product |\n\n## Nutritional Benefits of Hemp Seed Oil\n\nHemp seed oil has genuine benefits—just not CBD-related:\n\n- **Omega-3 and omega-6:** Good ratio for health\n- **Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA):** Anti-inflammatory fatty acid\n- **Vitamin E:** Antioxidant\n- **Minerals:** Magnesium, potassium, iron\n- **Protein:** Contains all essential amino acids\n\n\n> For more information, see our guide on [CBD Oil vs Hemp Seed Oil: What You Need to Know](/articles/cbd-oil-vs-hemp-seed-oil).\nIt is a healthy cooking oil and skincare ingredient.\n\n## Therapeutic Benefits of CBD Oil\n\nCBD oil provides different benefits:\n\n- **[Anxiety](/conditions/anxiety) relief:** Interaction with [serotonin](/conditions/serotonin) receptors\n- **[Pain](/conditions/pain) management:** [Endocannabinoid system](/glossary/endocannabinoid-system) effects\n- **[Sleep](/conditions/sleep) support:** May improve sleep quality\n- **Anti-inflammatory:** Multiple pathways\n- **Other potential benefits:** Research ongoing\n\n## How to Tell Them Apart\n\n### Check the Label\n\n**CBD oil should show:**\n- CBD content in milligrams\n- Often specifies \"cannabidiol\"\n- May indicate spectrum type (full, broad, isolate)\n\n**Hemp seed oil typically shows:**\n- \"Hemp seed oil\" or \"Cannabis sativa seed oil\"\n- No CBD content listed\n- May mention nutritional content (omega fatty acids)\n\n### Check the Price\n\n- CBD oil: EUR 30-100+ depending on strength\n- Hemp seed oil: EUR 10-20 for a similar-sized bottle\n\nIf it is very cheap and claims hemp/cannabis benefits, it is likely hemp seed oil without significant CBD.\n\n### Check the Source\n\n- CBD oil: Extracted from flowers/aerial parts\n- Hemp seed oil: Pressed from seeds\n\nThe ingredient list should indicate the source.\n\n## Common Misleading Labelling\n\nWatch for products that:\n\n- Say \"hemp oil\" prominently but do not specify CBD content\n- Show hemp leaves on packaging but contain only seed oil\n- Use terms like \"cannabis sativa oil\" (could be either)\n- Claim benefits associated with CBD but contain none\n- Have very low prices for allegedly high-strength products\n\n\n## My Take\n\nAfter testing hundreds of products over the years, I've seen countless consumers buy hemp seed oil thinking they're getting CBD—and wonder why they feel nothing. This confusion drives me crazy because it often turns people away from legitimate CBD products.\n\nIn my experience, hemp seed oil is fantastic as a nutritional supplement—it's loaded with omega fatty acids and has a pleasant nutty flavor. I keep it in my kitchen pantry, not my medicine cabinet. But if you're dealing with anxiety, pain, or sleep issues, hemp seed oil won't help. You need actual CBD oil extracted from the plant's flowers and leaves.\n\nI typically recommend starting with a quality full-spectrum CBD oil from reputable brands I've tested. The only time I suggest hemp seed oil is when someone specifically wants the nutritional benefits or cooking applications. Just know what you're buying—read labels carefully and look for CBD content listings, not just \"hemp\" on the package.\n\n---\n\n## Related Studies\n\nResearch related to this topic:\n\n- [Unveiling [Neurological](/conditions/neurological) Benefits: A Review of Hemp Leaf, Flower, Seed Oil Extract...

Hemp seeds contain only trace amounts of cannabinoids that may contaminate the surface from other plant parts. Any CBD present would be negligible and not therapeutic.\n\n### Can I use hemp seed oil for anxiety?\n\nHemp seed oil will not help anxiety through CBD mechanisms (it contains no CBD). The omega fatty acids may support general brain health, but you will not get the anxiolytic effects associated with CBD.\n\n### Why is hemp seed oil sold with hemp leaves on the label?\n\nMarketing. Hemp leaves suggest cannabis benefits, even though the product contains only seed oil without cannabinoids. This imagery can mislead consumers into thinking they are getting CBD effects.\n\n### Is hemp seed oil a scam?\n\nNo, hemp seed oil is a legitimate, nutritious product—just not a source of CBD. The problem is when it is marketed misleadingly to imply CBD benefits. As a food oil or skincare ingredient, it has genuine value.\n\n### Which is more expensive—CBD oil or hemp seed oil?\n\nCBD oil is significantly more expensive because extracting CBD from hemp flowers requires specialized processes. Hemp seed oil is a conventional food oil with simple production, hence lower cost.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\n**If you want CBD benefits:** Buy CBD oil with clearly labelled CBD content in milligrams from a reputable source.\n\n**If you want nutritional omega fatty acids:** Hemp seed oil is a healthy, affordable choice for cooking or skincare.\n\n**Do not confuse them:** They are different products from different parts of the plant with different compositions and uses. Confusing labelling is common—always verify CBD content before purchasing.\n\n---\n\n*Last Updated: January 2026*\n\n**Note:** Always buy CBD products from reputable sources that provide third-party lab testing and clearly label CBD content.\n\n---\n\n**Medical Disclaimer:** This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.
